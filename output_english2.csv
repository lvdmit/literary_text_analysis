PART ONE


Chapter 1

Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its
own way.

Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had
discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French
girl
to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with
him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days
the husband and wife themselves
and household
house felt that there was no sense in their living together
the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in
common with one another than they
household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room
husband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all
over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper
and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for
her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time;
the kitchen-maid

Three days after the quarrel
Oblonsky—Stiva
his usual hour
wife’s bedroom
over his stout
would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow
on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped
up

“Yes
was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no

“Ah
happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was
present to his imagination
worst of all

“Yes
awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault
not to blame. That’s the point of the whole situation
“Oh
acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.

Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when
good-humored
wife
had not found her in the study either

She

with the letter in her hand
horror

“What’s this? this?” she asked

And at this recollection
was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he
had met his wife’s words.

There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when
they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not
succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed
towards his wife by the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt
denying
indifferent even—anything would have been better than what he did
do—his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action
Stepan Arkadyevitch
assumed its habitual

This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that
smile

room. Since then she had refused to see her husband.

“It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all
Arkadyevitch.

“But what’s to be done? What’s to be done?” he said to himself in
despair


Chapter 2

Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself.
He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he
repented of his conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact
that he
with his wife
only a year younger than himself. All he repented of was that he had
not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife. But he felt all the
difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife
and himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better
from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would
have had such an effect on her. He had never clearly thought out the
subject
suspected him of being unfaithful to her
fact. He had even supposed that she
or good-looking
mother
had turned out quite the other way.

“Oh
repeating to himself
how well things were going up till now! how well we got on! She was
contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in
anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she
liked. It’s true it’s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.
That’s bad! There’s something common
governess. But what a governess!” (He vividly recalled the roguish
black eyes of Mlle. Roland and her smile.) “But after all
was in the house
that she’s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh
oh! But what

There was no solution
all questions
must live in the needs of the day—that is
himself in sleep was impossible now
not go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must
forget himself in the dream of daily life.

“Then we shall see
up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk
tassels in a knot

turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily. He pulled
up the blind and rang the bell loudly. It was at once answered by the
appearance of an old friend
his boots
the necessaries for shaving.

“Are there any papers from the office?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch
taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.

“On the table
master; and
sent from the carriage-jobbers.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply
looking-glass. In the glance
looking-glass
Arkadyevitch’s eyes asked: “Why do you tell me that? don’t you know?”

Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets
gazed silently

“I told them to come on Sunday

sentence beforehand.

Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract
attention to himself. Tearing open the telegram
guessing at the words
his face brightened.

“Matvey

pink path through his long

“Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?”

“Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.”

“Darya Alexandrovna?” Matvey repeated

“Yes
what she tells you.”

“You want to try it on
sir.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be
dressed
back into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.

“Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let
him do—that is you—as he likes
and putting his hands in his pockets
head on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute. Then a
good-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome
face.

“Eh

“It’s all right

“Come round?”

“Yes

“Do you think so? Who’s there?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch

Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse’s collar
blowing off some invisible speck
over the well-groomed body of his master.

When he was dressed

he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room
coffee was already waiting for him
papers from the office.

He read the letters. One was very unpleasant
buying a forest on his wife’s property. To sell this forest was
absolutely essential; but at present
wife
all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the
question of his reconciliation with his wife. And the idea that he
might be led on by his interests
with his wife on account of the sale of the forest—that idea hurt him.

When he had finished his letters

Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper
one
the fact that science

by the majority and by his paper
majority changed them—or
them

Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views;
these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves
as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat
those that were being worn. And for him
society—owing to the need
for some degree of mental activity—to have views was just as
indispensable as to have a hat. If there was a reason for his
preferring liberal to conservative views
of his circle
rational
life. The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong
certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of
money. The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out
of date

lying and hypocrisy

only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and
Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without
his legs aching from standing up
object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world
when life might be so very amusing in this world. And with all this
Stepan Arkadyevitch
by saying that if he prided himself on his origin
at Rurik and disown the first founder of his family—the monkey. And so
Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s

state of the household. He read

of the sale of a light carriage
situation; but these items of information did not give him
quiet
of coffee and a roll and butter
roll off his waistcoat; and
joyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his
mind—the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.

But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him
thoughtful.

Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of
Grisha
outside the door. They were carrying something

a smile to his father’s chilly smile.

“Mamma? She is up

Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed. “That means that she’s not slept again all
night

“Well

The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and
mother
must be aware of this
it so lightly. And she blushed for her father. He at once perceived it
and blushed too.

“I don’t know
she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma’s.”

“Well

He took off the mantelpiece

and a fondant.

“For Grisha?” said the little girl

“Yes

“The carriage is ready
with a petition.”

“Been here long?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“Half an hour.”

“How many times have I told you to tell me at once?”

“One must let you drink your coffee in peace

angry.

“Well

generally did
without interrupting her
whom to apply

might be of use to her. Having got rid of the staff captain’s widow
Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he
had forgotten anything. It appeared that he had forgotten nothing
except what he wanted to forget—his wife.

“Ah

because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to

Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and
lying were opposed to his nature.

“It must be some time
trying to give himself courage. He squared his chest

to do this; but now again

at least of the suffering he had caused her. She still continued to
tell herself that she should leave him

habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him. Besides this
realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to
look after her five children properly

as though looking for something
had come quite up to her. But her face

“Dolly!” he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his head towards
his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble

his figure that beamed with health and freshness. “Yes
content!” she thought; “while I.... And that disgusting good nature
which everyone likes him for and praises—I hate that good nature of
his

“What do you want?” she said in a rapid

“Well

“But you must

“Go away

Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife
hope that she would _come round_
quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he
saw her tortured
submissive to fate and full of despair
and a lump in his throat

“My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God’s sake!... You know....” He
could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.

She shut the bureau with a slam

She sat down. He listened to her hard

“It is awful! awful!” he said.

At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had
fallen down. Darya Alexandrovna listened

She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds
she did not know where she was

Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.

“You won’t dine at home?” said Matvey

from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off

she thought. “Can it be he sees her? Why didn’t I ask him! No

significance the word so dreadful to her. “And how I loved him! my God

Chapter 5

Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school
excellent abilities
therefore was one of the lowest in his class. But in spite of his
habitually dissipated mode of life
and his comparative youth
position of president of one of the government boards at Moscow. This
post he had received through his sister Anna’s husband
Alexandrovitch Karenin
the ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged. But if
Karenin had not got his brother-in-law this berth
hundred other personages—brothers
aunts—Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post
similar one
needful for him
property

Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan
Arkadyevitch. He was born in the midst of those who had been and are
the powerful ones of this world. One-third of the men in the
government
known him in petticoats; another third were his intimate chums
remainder were friendly acquaintances. Consequently the distributors of
earthly blessings in the shape of places
all his friends
Oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative
post. He had only not to refuse things
quarrelsome or take offense
nature he never did. It would have struck him as absurd if he had been
told that he would not get a position with the salary he required
especially as he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what
the men of his own age and standing did get
qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man.

Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his
good humor
honesty. In him
black hair and eyebrows
something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor
on the people who met him. “Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! Here he is!” was
almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him. Even though
it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that
nothing particularly delightful had happened
next

After filling for three years the post of president of one of the
government boards at Moscow
as well as the liking
superiors
qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal
respect in the service consisted
indulgence for others
shortcomings; secondly
read of in the papers
virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the
same
important point—his complete indifference to the business in which he
was engaged
never made mistakes.

On reaching the offices of the board
a deferential porter with a portfolio
room
copyists all rose
Arkadyevitch moved quickly

much as was consistent with due decorum
better than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between

“We have succeeded in getting the information from the government
department of Penza. Here

“You’ve got them at last?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
on the paper. “Now

And the sitting of the board began.

“If they knew
he listened to the report
was half an hour ago.” And his eyes were laughing during the reading of
the report. Till two o’clock the sitting would go on without a break
and at two o’clock there would be an interval and luncheon.

It was not yet two

All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the
Tsar and the eagle
door; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the
intruder

When the case had been read through

out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room. Two of
the members of the board

“We shall have time to finish after lunch

“To be sure we shall!” said Nikitin.

“A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be

Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch’s words
to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely
made him no reply.

“Who was that came in?” he asked the doorkeeper.

“Someone
was turned. He was asking for you. I told him: when the members come

portfolio—stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of
the stranger

Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs. His
good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform
beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up.

“Why
mocking smile
deigned to look me up in this den?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
content with shaking hands
long?”

“I have just come
looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.

“Well
friend’s sensitive and irritable shyness
him along

Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his
acquaintances
old men of sixty
adjutant-generals
at the extreme ends of the social ladder
surprised to learn that they had
something in common. He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom
he took a glass of champagne
everyone
as he used in joke to call many of his friends
subordinates
diminish the disagreeable impression made on them. Levin was not a
disreputable chum
fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his
subordinates

Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not
rest merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and companion of
his early youth. They were fond of one another in spite of the
difference of their characters and tastes
another who have been together in early youth. But in spite of this
each of them—as is often the way with men who have selected careers of
different kinds—though in discussion he would even justify the other’s
career
life he led himself was the only real life
friend was a mere phantasm. Oblonsky could not restrain a slight
mocking smile at the sight of Levin. How often he had seen him come up
to Moscow from the country where he was doing something
precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out
took no interest in the matter. Levin arrived in Moscow always excited
and in a hurry
ease
things. Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this
way Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend
and his official duties
But the difference was that Oblonsky
everyone did
laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.

“We have long been expecting you

danger was over. “I am very

Oblonsky noticed this at once

who lifts thirteen stone with one hand
and my friend

Though he had a great respect for his half-brother
known to all Russia
as Konstantin Levin

“No

“You’ve been quick about it!” said Oblonsky with a smile. “But how?
why?”

that nothing was really done by the district councils

young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the
other side” (he stammered) “it’s a means for the coterie of the
district to make money. Formerly they had wardships
now they have the district council—not in the form of bribes
the form of unearned salary

“Aha! You’re in a new phase again
Arkadyevitch. “However

“Yes

Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.

“How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?”
he said
I see: a new phase.”

Levin suddenly blushed
themselves aware of it
ridiculous through their shyness
blushing still more
strange to see this sensible
that Oblonsky left off looking at him.

“Oh
said Levin.

Oblonsky seemed to ponder.

“I’ll tell you what: let’s go to Gurin’s to lunch
talk. I am free till three.”

“No
somewhere else.”

“All right

“Dine together? But I have nothing very particular
say
afterwards.”

“Well
dinner.”

“Well

His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was
making to surmount his shyness.

“What are the Shtcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to be?” he
said.

Stepan Arkadyevitch
sister-in-law
sparkled merrily.

“You said a few words
Excuse me a minute....”

A secretary came in
consciousness
chief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with
some papers
some objection. Stepan Arkadyevitch
hand genially on the secretary’s sleeve.

“No
and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away
from the papers
Nikititch.”

The secretary retired in confusion. During the consultation with the
secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment. He was
standing with his elbows on the back of a chair
look of ironical attention.

“I don’t understand it

“What don’t you understand?” said Oblonsky
ever
Levin.

“I don’t understand what you are doing
shoulders. “How can you do it seriously?”

“Why not?”

“Why

“You think so

“On paper. But

“That’s to say

“Perhaps so
am proud that I’ve a friend in such a great person. You’ve not answered
my question
Oblonsky straight in the face.

“Oh
yourself. It’s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the
Karazinsky district
twelve; still you’ll be one of us one day. Yes
there is no change

“Oh

“Oh
brought you up to town?”

“Oh
up to his ears.

“All right. I see
to us
what; if you want to see them
Gardens from four to five. Kitty skates. You drive along there
I’ll come and fetch you

“Capital. So good-bye till then.”

“Now mind
Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.

“No

And Levin went out of the room
remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky’s
colleagues.

“That gentleman must be a man of great energy
Levin had gone away.

“Yes
lucky fellow! Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district;
everything before him; and what youth and vigor! Not like some of us.”

“You have a great deal to complain of
Arkadyevitch?”

“Ah
a heavy sigh.


Chapter 6

When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town
and was furious with himself for blushing
“I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer
precisely what he had come for.

The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old
Moscow families
This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin’s student days. He
had both prepared for the university with the young Prince
Shtcherbatsky
same time with him. In those days Levin used often to be in the
Shtcherbatskys’ house
household. Strange as it may appear
family
half of the household. Levin did not remember his own mother
only sister was older than he was
Shtcherbatskys’ house that he saw for the first time that inner life of
an old
deprived by the death of his father and mother. All the members of that
family
wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil
perceived no defects whatever in them
shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and
every possible perfection. Why it was the three young ladies had one
day to speak French
hours they played by turns on the piano
audible in their brother’s room above
why they were visited by those professors of French literature
music
ladies
boulevard
in a half-long one
tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was
they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with
a gold cockade in his hat—all this and much more that was done in their
mysterious world he did not understand
that was done there was very good
the mystery of the proceedings.

In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest
but she was soon married to Oblonsky. Then he began being in love with
the second. He felt
the sisters
had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the
diplomat Lvov. Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.
Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy
Levin’s relations with the Shtcherbatskys
with Oblonsky
this year Levin came to Moscow
the Shtcherbatskys
indeed destined to love.

One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him
man of good family
make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all
likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match. But
Levin was in love
every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and
that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be
conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy
of her.

After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment
Kitty almost every day in society
her
country.

Levin’s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in
the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for
the charming Kitty
family’s eyes he had no ordinary
society
were already
of a bank and railways
(he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country
gentleman
barns; in other words
well
is done by people fit for nothing else.

The mysterious
person as he conceived himself to be
in no way striking person. Moreover
past—the attitude of a grown-up person to a child
friendship with her brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love.
An ugly
supposed
that with which he loved Kitty
still more

He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men
he did not believe it
himself have loved any but beautiful
women.

But after spending two months alone in the country
that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience
in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant’s rest;
that he could not live without deciding the question
would she not be his wife
his own imaginings
rejected. And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to
make an offer
conceive what would become of him if he were rejected.


Chapter 7

On arriving in Moscow by a morning train
of his elder half-brother
went down to his brother’s study
about the object of his visit
was not alone. With him there was a well-known professor of philosophy
who had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had
arisen between them on a very important philosophical question. The
professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists. Sergey
Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest
reading the professor’s last article
stating his objections. He accused the professor of making too great
concessions to the materialists. And the professor had promptly
appeared to argue the matter out. The point in discussion was the
question then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between
psychological and physiological phenomena in man? and if so

Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness
he always had for everyone
on with the conversation.

A little man in spectacles
the discussion for an instant to greet Levin
without paying any further attention to him. Levin sat down to wait
till the professor should go
the subject under discussion.

Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were
disputing
the first principles of science
student at the university. But he had never connected these scientific
deductions as to the origin of man as an animal
biology
and death to himself
mind.

As he listened to his brother’s argument with the professor
that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual
problems
time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point
promptly beat a hasty retreat
distinctions
authorities
were talking about.

“I cannot admit it
clearness
in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external
world has been derived from perceptions. The most fundamental idea
idea of existence
indeed
idea.”

“Yes
consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your
sensations
sensations. Wurt
sensations

“I maintain the contrary

But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real
point of the matter
mind to put a question to the professor.

“According to that
can have no existence of any sort?” he queried.

The professor
interruption
bargeman than a philosopher
Ivanovitch
Ivanovitch
than the professor
the professor
natural point of view from which the question was put

“That question we have no right to answer as yet.”

“We have not the requisite data
back to his argument. “No
if
then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two
conceptions.”

Levin listened no more


Chapter 8

When the professor had gone

“Delighted that you’ve come. For some time
getting on?”

Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming
only put the question in deference to him
about the sale of his wheat and money matters.

Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get
married
But after seeing his brother
professor
which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their
mother’s property had not been divided
their shares)
talk to him of his intention of marrying. He felt that his brother
would not look at it as he would have wished him to.

“Well
who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great
importance to them.

“I really don’t know.”

“What! Why

“No
longer attend the meetings.”

“What a pity!” commented Sergey Ivanovitch

Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings
in his district.

“That’s how it always is!” Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him. “We
Russians are always like that. Perhaps it’s our strong point
the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it
comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our
tongues. All I say is
any other European people—why
worked their way to freedom from them
ridicule.”

“But how can it be helped?” said Levin penitently. “It was my last
effort. And I did try with all my soul. I can’t. I’m no good at it.”

“It’s not that you’re no good at it
that you don’t look at it as you should.”

“Perhaps not

“Oh! do you know brother Nikolay’s turned up again?”

This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin
half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined
dissipated the greater part of his fortune
and lowest company

“What did you say?” Levin cried with horror. “How do you know?”

“Prokofy saw him in the street.”

“Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?” Levin got up from his
chair

“I am sorry I told you
his younger brother’s excitement. “I sent to find out where he is
living
answer he sent me.”

And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed
it to his brother.

Levin read in the queer
leave me in peace. That’s the only favor I ask of my gracious
brothers.—Nikolay Levin.”

Levin read it
hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.

There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his
unhappy brother for the time
base to do so.

“He obviously wants to offend me
cannot offend me
him

“Yes
to him; but I shall go and see him.”

“If you want to
Ivanovitch. “As regards myself
will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake
you would do better not to go. You can’t do him any good; still
you please.”

“Very likely I can’t do any good
moment—but that’s another thing—I feel I could not be at peace.”

“Well
do understand
look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous
since brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he
did....”

“Oh

After obtaining his brother’s address from Sergey Ivanovitch’s footman
Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him
thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening. The first
thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come
to Moscow for. From his brother’s Levin went to Oblonsky’s office
on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him
where he had been told he might find Kitty.


Chapter 9

At four o’clock
a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens
the frozen mounds and the skating ground
certainly find her there
at the entrance.

It was a bright
policemen were standing in the approach. Crowds of well-dressed people
with hats bright in the sun
well-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving
in the Russian style. The old curly birches of the gardens
twigs laden with snow
vestments.

He walked along the path towards the skating-ground
himself—“You mustn’t be excited
with you? What do you want? Be quiet
And the more he tried to compose himself
himself. An acquaintance met him and called him by his name
did not even recognize him. He went towards the mounds
clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up
the rumble of the sliding sledges
walked on a few steps
and at once

He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his
heart. She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the
ground. There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or
her attitude. But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a
rose among nettles. Everything was made bright by her. She was the
smile that shed light on all round her. “Is it possible I can go over
there on the ice
seemed to him a holy shrine
when he was almost retreating
had to make an effort to master himself
people of all sorts were moving about her
there to skate. He walked down
her as at the sun
looking.

On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set
acquainted with one another
skaters there
with timid
hygienic motives. They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings
because they were here
perfect self-possession
to her
and the fine weather.

“Ah
your skates on.”

“I haven’t got my skates

near him. She was in a corner

she gave herself a push off with one foot
Shtcherbatsky. Clutching at his arm
was more splendid than he had imagined her.

When he thought of her
himself
on the shapely girlish shoulders
and good humor. The childishness of her expression
delicate beauty of her figure
fully realized. But what always struck him in her as something unlooked
for
above all
world

“Have you been here long?” she said
she added

“I? I’ve not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I arrived
answered Levin
“I was meaning to come and see you
with what intention he was trying to see her
with confusion and blushed.

“I didn’t know you could skate

She looked at him earnestly
his confusion.

“Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that you
are the best of skaters
brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.

“Yes

“You do everything with passion
so like to see how you skate. Put on skates
together.”

“Skate together! Can that be possible?” thought Levin

“I’ll put them on directly

And he went off to get skates.

“It’s a long while since we’ve seen you here
supporting his foot
you
right?” said he

“Oh
restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face.
“Yes
she said; _let us skate together!_ Speak to her now? But that’s just
why I’m afraid to speak—because I’m happy now
anyway.... And then?... But I must! I must! I must! Away with
weakness!”

Levin rose to his feet
rough ice round the hut
effort
slackening speed and turning his course. He approached with timidity
but again her smile reassured him.

She gave him her hand
faster
his hand.

“With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you
said to him.

“And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me
but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said
indeed
the sun going behind a cloud
Levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the
working of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.

“Is there anything troubling you?—though I’ve no right to ask such a
question

“Oh
coldly; and she added immediately: “You haven’t seen Mlle. Linon
you?”

“Not yet.”

“Go and speak to her

“What’s wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!” thought Levin
he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets
sitting on a bench. Smiling and showing her false teeth
him as an old friend.

“Yes
Kitty
Frenchwoman
young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English
nursery tale. “Do you remember that’s what you used to call them?”

He remembered absolutely nothing
for ten years now

“Now
nicely

When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes
looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness
fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate
composure. And he felt depressed. After talking a little of her old
governess and her peculiarities

“Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter
said.

“No
holding him in check by her composed tone
force to break through
winter.

“Are you going to stay in town long?” Kitty questioned him.

“I don’t know
thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness
he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into
his mind

“How is it you don’t know?”

“I don’t know. It depends upon you
horror-stricken at his own words.

Whether it was that she had heard his words
to hear them
hurriedly skated away from him. She skated up to Mlle. Linon
something to her
off their skates.

“My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me
Levin

At that moment one of the young men
day
his mouth. Taking a run
crashing and bounding up and down. He flew down
changing the position of his hands

“Ah
to do this new trick.

“Don’t break your neck! it needs practice!” Nikolay Shtcherbatsky
shouted after him.

Levin went to the steps
dashed down
hands. On the last step he stumbled
his hand
laughing.

“How splendid
came out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon
a smile of quiet affection
can it be my fault
flirtation. I know it’s not he that I love; but still I am happy with
him

Catching sight of Kitty going away
steps
a minute. He took off his skates
at the entrance of the gardens.

“Delighted to see you
are home

“Today

“We shall be pleased to see you

This stiffness hurt Kitty
smooth over her mother’s coldness. She turned her head
smile said:

“Good-bye till this evening.”

At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch
beaming face and eyes
But as he approached his mother-in-law
crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly’s health. After a little
subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law

“Well

“Yes

the smile with which it was said.

“To the England or the Hermitage?”

“I don’t mind which.”

“All right

consequently considered it mean to avoid it. “Have you got a sledge?
That’s first-rate

The friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what that
change in Kitty’s expression had meant
himself that there was hope
that his hopes were insane

Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu
of the dinner.

“You like turbot

“Eh?” responded Levin. “Turbot? Yes


Chapter 10

When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky
noticing a certain peculiarity of expression
radiance
Oblonsky took off his overcoat
into the dining-room
clustered about him in evening coats
and left to the people he met
acquaintances
of fish and vodka
ribbons
that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for his
part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a
loathing of that Frenchwoman

from her
memories of Kitty
shining in his eyes.

“This way

“If you prefer it
directly; Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come in.”

“Ah! oysters.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.

“How if we were to change our program
finger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious hesitation.
“Are the oysters good? Mind now.”

“They’re Flensburg

“Flensburg will do

“Only arrived yesterday.”

“Well

“It’s all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and porridge

Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin

“Not bad

Levin ate the oysters indeed

uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate
glasses
with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.

“You don’t care much for oysters
emptying his wine-glass

He wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin was
not in good spirits; he was ill at ease. With what he had in his soul
he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant
private rooms where men were dining with ladies
bustle; the surroundings of bronzes
waiters—all of it was offensive to him. He was afraid of sullying what
his soul was brimful of.

“I? Yes
conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me
as that gentleman’s nails I saw at your place....”

“Yes
said Stepan Arkadyevitch

“It’s too much for me
in my place
country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most
convenient for working with. So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up
our sleeves. And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as
they will
do nothing with their hands.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.

“Oh
work is with the mind....”

“Maybe. But still it’s queer to me
queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as
we can
drag out our meal as long as possible
oysters....”

“Why
aim of civilization—to make everything a source of enjoyment.”

“Well

“And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages.”

Levin sighed. He remembered his brother Nikolay
sore
once drew his attention.

“Oh
mean?” he said
empty rough shells

“Yes
princess was not very warm in her invitation.”

“What nonsense! That’s her manner.... Come
her manner—_grande dame
but I have to go to the Countess Bonina’s rehearsal. Come
true that you’re a savage? How do you explain the sudden way in which
you vanished from Moscow? The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me
about you
always do what no one else does.”

“Yes
savage. Only
now. Now I have come....”

“Oh
looking into Levin’s eyes.

“Why?”

“‘I know a gallant steed by tokens sure

And by his eyes I know a youth in love



declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Everything is before you.”

“Why

“No; not over exactly
mine

“How so?”

“Oh
can’t explain it all
come to Moscow

“You guess?” responded Levin
on Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“I guess
that whether I guess right or wrong
at Levin with a subtle smile.

“Well
voice
“How do you look at the question?”

Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis
his eyes off Levin.

“I?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
that—nothing! It would be the best thing that could be.”

“But you’re not making a mistake? You know what we’re speaking of?”
said Levin

“I think it’s possible. Why not possible?”

“No! do you really think it’s possible? No
but if ... if refusal’s in store for me!... Indeed I feel sure....”

“Why should you think that?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
excitement.

“It seems so to me sometimes. That will be awful for me
too.”

“Oh
proud of an offer.”

“Yes

Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He so well knew that feeling of Levin’s
that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes:
one class—all the girls in the world except her
all sorts of human weaknesses
class—she alone
humanity.

“Stay
pushed away the sauce.

Levin obediently helped himself to sauce
Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner.

“No
it’s a question of life and death for me. I have never spoken to anyone
of this. And there’s no one I could speak of it to
know we’re utterly unlike each other
everything; but I know you’re fond of me and understand me
why I like you awfully. But for God’s sake
with me.”

“I tell you what I think
say more: my wife is a wonderful woman....” Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed
remembering his position with his wife
resumed—“She has a gift of foreseeing things. She sees right through
people; but that’s not all; she knows what will come to pass
especially in the way of marriages. She foretold
Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln. No one would believe it
it came to pass. And she’s on your side.”

“How do you mean?”

“It’s not only that she likes you—she says that Kitty is certain to be
your wife.”

At these words Levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile
not far from tears of emotion.

“She says that!” cried Levin. “I always said she was exquisite
wife. There
from his seat.

“All right

But Levin could not sit down. He walked with his firm tread twice up
and down the little cage of a room
might not fall

“You must understand
it’s not that. It’s not my feeling
taken possession of me. I went away
that it could never be
come on earth; but I’ve struggled with myself
without it. And it must be settled.”

“What did you go away for?”

“Ah
questions one must ask oneself! Listen. You can’t imagine what you’ve
done for me by what you said. I’m so happy that I’ve become positively
hateful; I’ve forgotten everything. I heard today that my brother
Nikolay ... you know
to me that he’s happy too. It’s a sort of madness. But one thing’s
awful.... Here
awful that we—old—with a past ... not of love
brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it’s
loathsome

“Oh

“Alas! all the same
life

“What would you have? The world’s made so

“The one comfort is like that prayer
not according to my unworthiness
loving-kindness.’ That’s the only way she can forgive me.”


Chapter 11

Levin emptied his glass

“There’s one other thing I ought to tell you. Do you know Vronsky?”
Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.

“No

“Give us another bottle
was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was
not wanted.

“Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he’s one of your rivals.”

“Who’s Vronsky?” said Levin
the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to
an angry and unpleasant expression.

“Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky
of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg. I made his
acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business
there for the levy of recruits. Fearfully rich
connections
good-natured fellow. But he’s more than simply a good-natured fellow
as I’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man
intelligent; he’s a man who’ll make his mark.”

Levin scowled and was dumb.

“Well
over head and ears in love with Kitty
mother....”

“Excuse me
immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was
to have been able to forget him.

“You wait a bit
touching his hand. “I’ve told you what I know
this delicate and tender matter
believe the chances are in your favor.”

Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.

“But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be
Oblonsky

“No
glass. “I shall be drunk.... Come
went on

“One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.
Tonight I don’t advise you to speak
round tomorrow morning
you....”

“Oh
spring

Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this
conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch. A feeling such as his was
profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer
suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.

Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He knew what was passing in Levin’s soul.

“I’ll come some day
everything turns upon. Things are in a bad way with me
it’s all through women. Tell me frankly now
cigar and keeping one hand on his glass; “give me your advice.”

“Why

“I’ll tell you. Suppose you’re married
fascinated by another woman....”

“Excuse me
can’t comprehend how I could now
baker’s shop and steal a roll.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled more than usual.

“Why not? A roll will sometimes smell so good one can’t resist it.”

“Himmlisch ist’s

    Meine irdische Begier;

Aber doch wenn’s nich gelungen

    Hatt’ ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir!”



As he said this
not help smiling.

“Yes
understand that the woman is a sweet
lonely
don’t you see
from her
feeling for her

“Well
into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and
there are ... I’ve never seen exquisite fallen beings
shall see them
counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind
are the same.”

“But the Magdalen?”

“Ah
known how they would be abused. Of all the Gospel those words are the
only ones remembered. However
what I feel. I have a loathing for fallen women. You’re afraid of
spiders
spiders and don’t know their character; and so it is with me.”

“It’s very well for you to talk like that; it’s very much like that
gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his
right shoulder. But to deny the facts is no answer. What’s to be
done—you tell me that
you’re full of life. Before you’ve time to look round
you can’t love your wife with love
And then all at once love turns up
Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.

Levin half smiled.

“Yes

“Don’t steal rolls.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.

“Oh
insists only on her rights
can’t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks
for nothing. What are you to do? How are you to act? There’s a fearful
tragedy in it.”

“If you care for my profession of faith as regards that
that I don’t believe there was any tragedy about it. And this is why.
To my mind
defines in his Banquet
understand one sort
the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy. In such love
there can be no sort of tragedy. ‘I’m much obliged for the
gratification
platonic love there can be no tragedy
clear and pure

At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict
he had lived through. And he added unexpectedly:

“But perhaps you are right. Very likely ... I don’t know
know.”

“It’s this
all of a piece. That’s your strong point and your failing. You have a
character that’s all of a piece
of a piece too—but that’s not how it is. You despise public official
work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all
the while with the aim—and that’s not how it is. You want a man’s work
too
be undivided—and that’s not how it is. All the variety
all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.”

Levin sighed and made no reply. He was thinking of his own affairs
did not hear Oblonsky.

And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends
they had been dining and drinking together
them closer
had nothing to do with one another. Oblonsky had more than once
experienced this extreme sense of aloofness
coming on after dinner

“Bill!” he called
came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into
conversation with him about an actress and her protector. And at once
in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of
relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin
put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.

Chapter 12

The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen. It was the first
winter that she had been out in the world. Her success in society had
been greater than that of either of her elder sisters
than her mother had anticipated. To say nothing of the young men who
danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty
serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance:
Levin

Levin’s appearance at the beginning of the winter
and evident love for Kitty
between Kitty’s parents as to her future
The prince was on Levin’s side; he said he wished for nothing better
for Kitty. The princess for her part
manner peculiar to women
Levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions
Kitty felt no great attraction to him
did not state the principal point
better match for her daughter
and she did not understand him. When Levin had abruptly departed
princess was delighted
I was right.” When Vronsky appeared on the scene
delighted
good

In the mother’s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and
Levin. She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions
and his shyness in society
his queer sort of life
peasants. She did not very much like it that he
her daughter
were waiting for something
might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer
realize that a man
young unmarried girl
suddenly
attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him
the mother.

Vronsky satisfied all the mother’s desires. Very wealthy
aristocratic family
and at court
for.

Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls
continually to the house
seriousness of his intentions. But
spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and
agitation.

Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago
aunt arranging the match. Her husband
known beforehand
at. The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual
impression. That impression had been favorable. Afterwards
fixed beforehand
accepted. All had passed very simply and easily. So it seemed
least
from simple and easy is the business
marrying off one’s daughters. The panics that had been lived through
the thoughts that had been brooded over
wasted
girls
going through the same terrors
quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls. The old
prince
score of the honor and reputation of his daughters. He was irrationally
jealous over his daughters
favorite. At every turn he had scenes with the princess for
compromising her daughter. The princess had grown accustomed to this
already with her other daughters
ground for the prince’s touchiness. She saw that of late years much was
changed in the manners of society
still more difficult. She saw that girls of Kitty’s age formed some
sort of clubs
society; drove about the streets alone
and
convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair
their parents’. “Marriages aren’t made nowadays as they used to be
was thought and said by all these young girls
elders. But how marriages were made now
from anyone. The French fashion—of the parents arranging their
children’s future—was not accepted; it was condemned. The English
fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted
and not possible in Russian society. The Russian fashion of matchmaking
by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered
unseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone
But how girls were to be married
no one knew. Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the
matter said the same thing: “Mercy on us
cast off all that old-fashioned business. It’s the young people have to
marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people
to arrange it as they choose.” It was very easy for anyone to say that
who had no daughters
getting to know each other
in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite
unfit to be her husband. And
princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives
for themselves
been unable to believe that
playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols. And
so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her
elder sisters.

Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply
flirting with her daughter. She saw that her daughter was in love with
him
honorable man
easy it is
head
before
Vronsky during a mazurka. This conversation had partly reassured the
princess; but perfectly at ease she could not be. Vronsky had told
Kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother
that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking
without consulting her. “And just now
mother’s arrival from Petersburg
her.

Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the
words. But her mother saw them in a different light. She knew that the
old lady was expected from day to day
son’s choice
through fear of vexing his mother. However
marriage itself
believed it was so. Bitter as it was for the princess to see the
unhappiness of her eldest daughter
husband
engrossed all her feelings. Today
source of anxiety arose. She was afraid that her daughter
one time
sense of honor
generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.

“Why
returned home.

“He came today

“There’s one thing I want to say....” began the princess
serious and alert face

“Mamma
please don’t say anything about that. I know

She wished for what her mother wished for
mother’s wishes wounded her.

“I only want to say that to raise hopes....”

“Mamma
horrible to talk about it.”

“I won’t
“but one thing
me. You won’t?”

“Never
her mother straight in the face
anything
how.... I don’t know....”

“No
mother
that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor
child so immense and so important.


Chapter 13

After dinner
a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle. Her
heart throbbed violently

She felt that this evening
time
picturing them to herself
together. When she mused on the past
tenderness
of childhood and of Levin’s friendship with her dead brother gave a
special poetic charm to her relations with him. His love for her
which she felt certain
was pleasant for her to think of Levin. In her memories of Vronsky
there always entered a certain element of awkwardness
the highest degree well-bred and at ease
false note—not in Vronsky
while with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear. But
hand
before her a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future
seemed misty.

When she went upstairs to dress
noticed with joy that it was one of her good days
complete possession of all her forces
before her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in
her movements.

At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room
when the footman announced
princess was still in her room
is to be
heart. She was horrified at her paleness
looking-glass. At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come
early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer. And only
then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new
different aspect; only then she realized that the question did not
affect her only—with whom she would be happy
that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked. And to
wound him cruelly. What for? Because he
love with her. But there was no help for it
have to be.

“My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?” she thought.
“Can I tell him I don’t love him? That will be a lie. What am I to say
to him? That I love someone else? No
away

She had reached the door
honest. What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. What is
to be
ease. Here he is
figure
his face

“It’s not time yet; I think I’m too early
empty drawing-room. When he saw that his expectations were realized
that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking
gloomy.

“Oh

“But this was just what I wanted
sitting down

“Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired....
Yesterday....”

She talked on
her supplicating and caressing eyes off him.

He glanced at her; she blushed

“I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it
depended on you....”

She dropped her head lower and lower
she should make to what was coming.

“That it depended on you
say ... I came for this ... to be my wife!” he brought out
what he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said
he stopped short and looked at her....

She was breathing heavily
Her soul was flooded with happiness. She had never anticipated that the
utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her. But it
lasted only an instant. She remembered Vronsky. She lifted her clear
truthful eyes

“That cannot be ... forgive me.”

A moment ago
his life! And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!

“It was bound to be so

He bowed


Chapter 14

But at that very moment the princess came in. There was a look of
horror on her face when she saw them alone
Levin bowed to her
eyes. “Thank God
face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her
guests on Thursdays. She sat down and began questioning Levin about his
life in the country. He sat down again
arrive

Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty’s
preceding winter

She was a thin
eyes. She was fond of Kitty
as the affection of married women for girls always does
to make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she
wanted her to marry Vronsky. Levin she had often met at the
Shtcherbatskys’ early in the winter
Her invariable and favorite pursuit
fun of him.

“I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur
or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I’m a fool
is condescending to me. I like that so; to see him condescending! I am
so glad he can’t bear me

She was right
for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic—her
nervousness
coarse and earthly.

The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another
not seldom seen in society
friendly terms
even take each other seriously
other.

The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.

“Ah
Babylon
what he had chanced to say early in the winter
Babylon. “Come
added

“It’s very flattering for me
well
and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the
Countess Nordston. “They must certainly make a great impression on
you.”

“Oh
you been skating again?...”

And she began talking to Kitty. Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw
now
awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty
at him now and then and avoided his eyes. He was on the point of
getting up
him.

“Shall you be long in Moscow? You’re busy with the district council
though

“No
come up for a few days.”

“There’s something the matter with him
glancing at his stern
mood. But I’ll draw him out. I do love making a fool of him before
Kitty

“Konstantin Dmitrievitch
what’s the meaning of it. You know all about such things. At home in
our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up
all they possessed
meaning of that? You always praise the peasants so.”

At that instant another lady came into the room

“Excuse me
tell you anything
in behind the lady.

“That must be Vronsky
at Kitty. She had already had time to look at Vronsky
at Levin. And simply from the look in her eyes
brighter
she had told him so in words. But what sort of a man was he? Now
whether for good or for ill
find out what the man was like whom she loved.

There are people who
are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him
to see only what is bad. There are people
desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he
has outstripped them
is good. Levin belonged to the second class. But he had no difficulty
in finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky. It was apparent at
the first glance. Vronsky was a squarely built
tall
face. Everything about his face and figure
black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting
brand-new uniform
for the lady who had come in
to Kitty.

As he approached her
light
seemed to Levin)
out his small broad hand to her.

Greeting and saying a few words to everyone
glancing at Levin

“Let me introduce you
“Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin

Vronsky got up and

“I believe I was to have dined with you this winter
his simple and open smile; “but you had unexpectedly left for the
country.”

“Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople
said Countess Nordston.

“My words must make a deep impression on you
so well
same thing before

Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston

“Are you always in the country?” he inquired. “I should think it must
be dull in the winter.”

“It’s not dull if one has work to do; besides
oneself

“I am fond of the country
to notice

“But I hope
always

“I don’t know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a queer
feeling once
country
with my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull enough
indeed
it’s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly
especially the country. It’s as though....”

He talked on
friendly eyes from one to the other
came into his head.

Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something
short without finishing what he had begun
her.

The conversation did not flag for an instant
always kept in reserve
guns—the relative advantages of classical and of modern education
universal military service—had not to move out either of them
Countess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.

Levin wanted to
saying to himself every instant
though waiting for something.

The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits
Nordston
she had seen.

“Ah
see them! I have never seen anything extraordinary
on the lookout for it everywhere

“Very well
Konstantin Dmitrievitch

“Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say.”

“But I want to hear your opinion.”

“My opinion
proves that educated society—so called—is no higher than the peasants.
They believe in the evil eye
we....”

“Oh

“I can’t believe in it

“But if I’ve seen it myself?”

“The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.”

“Then you think I tell a lie?”

And she laughed a mirthless laugh.

“Oh
it
more exasperated
frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation
threatening to become disagreeable.

“You do not admit the conceivability at all?” he queried. “But why not?
We admit the existence of electricity
should there not be some new force

“When electricity was discovered
only the phenomenon that was discovered
it proceeded and what were its effects
applications were conceived. But the spiritualists have begun with
tables writing for them
later started saying that it is an unknown force.”

Vronsky listened attentively to Levin
obviously interested in his words.

“Yes
force is
it acts. Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.
No

“Why
you rub tar against wool
this case it does not happen every time
natural phenomenon.”

Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious
for a drawing-room
change the conversation

“Do let us try at once
saying what he thought.

“I think
explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.
They boldly talk of spiritual force
material experiment.”

Everyone was waiting for him to finish

“And I think you would be a first-rate medium
“there’s something enthusiastic in you.”

Levin opened his mouth
nothing.

“Do let us try table-turning at once
will you allow it?”

And Vronsky stood up

Kitty got up to fetch a table
She felt for him with her whole heart
him for suffering of which she was herself the cause. “If you can
forgive me

“I hate them all
up his hat. But he was not destined to escape. Just as they were
arranging themselves round the table
retiring
addressed Levin.

“Ah!” he began joyously. “Been here long
you were in town. Very glad to see you.” The old prince embraced Levin
and talking to him did not observe Vronsky
serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him.

Kitty felt how distasteful her father’s warmth was to Levin after what
had happened. She saw
Vronsky’s bow
father
could be hostilely disposed towards him

“Prince
“we want to try an experiment.”

“What experiment? Table-turning? Well
gentlemen
the old prince
suggestion. “There’s some sense in that

Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes
with a faint smile
the great ball that was to come off next week.

“I hope you will be there?” he said to Kitty. As soon as the old prince
turned away from him
he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling
Kitty answering Vronsky’s inquiry about the ball.


Chapter 15

At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation
with Levin
glad at the thought that she had received an _offer_. She had no doubt
that she had acted rightly. But after she had gone to bed
while she could not sleep. One impression pursued her relentlessly. It
was Levin’s face
out in dark dejection below them
and glancing at her and at Vronsky. And she felt so sorry for him that
tears came into her eyes. But immediately she thought of the man for
whom she had given him up. She vividly recalled his manly
face
everything towards everyone. She remembered the love for her of the man
she loved
the pillow
could I do? It’s not my fault
told her something else. Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin’s
love
poisoned by doubts. “Lord
Lord

Meanwhile there took place below
of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their
favorite daughter.

“What? I’ll tell you what!” shouted the prince
once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again. “That

once flown into a passion

“What have you done? I’ll tell you what. First of all
catch an eligible gentleman
with good reason. If you have evening parties
pick out the possible suitors. Invite all the young bucks. Engage a
piano player
hunting up good matches. It makes me sick
gone on till you’ve turned the poor wench’s head. Levin’s a thousand
times the better man. As for this little Petersburg swell
turned out by machinery
But if he were a prince of the blood

“Why

“Well

Ah! spiritualism! Ah! Nice! Ah! the ball!” And the prince

“And this is how we’re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she’s
really got the notion into her head....”

“But what makes you suppose so?”

“I don’t suppose; I know. We have eyes for such things

Chapter 16

Vronsky had never had a real home life. His mother had been in her
youth a brilliant society woman
and still more afterwards
fashionable world. His father he scarcely remembered
educated in the Corps of Pages.

Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer
got into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men. Although he did go
more or less into Petersburg society
hitherto been outside it.

In Moscow he had for the first time felt
coarse life at Petersburg
innocent girl of his own rank
his head that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty. At
balls he danced principally with her. He was a constant visitor at
their house. He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society—all
sorts of nonsense
special meaning in her case. Although he said nothing to her that he
could not have said before everybody
more and more dependent upon him
he liked it
that his mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite
character
marriage
among brilliant young men such as he was. It seemed to him that he was
the first who had discovered this pleasure
discovery.

If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening
could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have
heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her
have been greatly astonished
not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him
above all to her
that he ought to marry.

Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. He not
only disliked family life
in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he
lived
ridiculous.

But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were
saying
spiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much
stronger that evening that some step must be taken. But what step could
and ought to be taken he could not imagine.

“What is so exquisite
Shtcherbatskys’
feeling of purity and freshness
had not been smoking for a whole evening
tenderness at her love for him—“what is so exquisite is that not a word
has been said by me or by her
this unseen language of looks and tones
than ever she told me she loves me. And how secretly
of all
a heart
loving eyes! When she said: ‘Indeed I do....’

“Well
he began wondering where to finish the evening.

He passed in review of the places he might go to. “Club? a game of
bezique
Fleurs_; there I shall find Oblonsky
of it. That’s why I like the Shtcherbatskys’
I’ll go home.” He went straight to his room at Dussots’ Hotel
supper
fell into a sound sleep.


Chapter 17

Next day at eleven o’clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station
of the Petersburg railway to meet his mother
came across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky
expecting his sister by the same train.

“Ah! your excellency!” cried Oblonsky

“My mother
Oblonsky. He shook hands with him
steps. “She is to be here from Petersburg today.”

“I was looking out for you till two o’clock last night. Where did you
go after the Shtcherbatskys’?”

“Home
after the Shtcherbatskys’ that I didn’t care to go anywhere.”

“I know a gallant steed by tokens sure

And by his eyes I know a youth in love



declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch

Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it
but he promptly changed the subject.

“And whom are you meeting?” he asked.

“I? I’ve come to meet a pretty woman

“You don’t say so!”

“_Honi soit qui mal y pense!_ My sister Anna.”

“Ah! that’s Madame Karenina

“You know her

“I think I do. Or perhaps not ... I really am not sure
answered heedlessly
tedious evoked by the name Karenina.

“But Alexey Alexandrovitch
must know. All the world knows him.”

“I know him by reputation and by sight. I know that he’s clever

line

“Yes
man

“Oh
you’ve come
standing at the door; “come here.”

Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone
felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination
he was associated with Kitty.

“Well
_diva?_” he said to him with a smile

“Of course. I’m collecting subscriptions. Oh
acquaintance of my friend Levin?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“Yes; but he left rather early.”

“He’s a capital fellow

“I don’t know why it is
people—present company of course excepted
“there’s something uncompromising. They are all on the defensive
their tempers

“Yes
good-humoredly.

“Will the train soon be in?” Vronsky asked a railway official.

“The train’s signaled

The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory
bustle in the station
and attendants
could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing
the rails of the curving line. The hiss of the boiler could be heard on
the distant rails

“No
Vronsky of Levin’s intentions in regard to Kitty. “No
true impression of Levin. He’s a very nervous man
of humor
honest nature
reasons
oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his
friend
there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly
happy or particularly unhappy.”

Vronsky stood still and asked directly: “How so? Do you mean he made
your _belle-sœur_ an offer yesterday?”

“Maybe
yesterday. Yes
must mean it.... He’s been so long in love
him.”

“So that’s it! I should imagine
match
“though I don’t know him
position! That’s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras. If
you don’t succeed with them it only proves that you’ve not enough cash
but in this case one’s dignity’s at stake. But here’s the train.”

The engine had already whistled in the distance. A few instants later
the platform was quivering
air from the frost
wheel rhythmically moving up and down
engine-driver covered with frost. Behind the tender
platform more and more slowly swaying
whining in it. At last the passenger carriages rolled in
before coming to a standstill.

A smart guard jumped out
the impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards
holding himself erect
merchant with a satchel
shoulder.

Vronsky
passengers
about Kitty excited and delighted him. Unconsciously he arched his
chest

“Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment
going up to Vronsky.

The guard’s words roused him
his approaching meeting with her. He did not in his heart respect his
mother
though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived
with his own education
his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient
more externally obedient and respectful his behavior
heart he respected and loved her.


Chapter 18

Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage
compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting
out.

With the insight of a man of the world
appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society. He
begged pardon
glance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful
account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her
whole figure
she passed close by him
soft. As he looked round
eyes
attention on his face
promptly turned away to the passing crowd
In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness
which played over her face
the faint smile that curved her red lips. It was as though her nature
were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed
itself now in the flash of her eyes
she shrouded the light in her eyes
the faintly perceptible smile.

Vronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother
black eyes and ringlets
smiled slightly with her thin lips. Getting up from the seat and
handing her maid a bag
kiss

“You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.”

“You had a good journey?” said her son
involuntarily listening to a woman’s voice outside the door. He knew it
was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.

“All the same I don’t agree with you

“It’s the Petersburg view

“Not Petersburg

“Well

“Good-bye
and send him to me?” said the lady in the doorway
again into the compartment.

“Well
addressing the lady.

Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.

“Your brother is here
know you
bowing

“Oh
have been talking
spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself
in her smile. “And still no sign of my brother.”

“Do call him
the platform and shouted:

“Oblonsky! Here!”

Madame Karenina
sight of him she stepped out with her light
as her brother had reached her
its decision and its grace
drew him rapidly to her
taking his eyes from her
recollecting that his mother was waiting for him
into the carriage.

“She’s very sweet
“Her husband put her with me
been talking all the way. And so you
amour. Tant mieux

“I don’t know what you are referring to
“Come

Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the
countess.

“Well
“And all my gossip is exhausted. I should have nothing more to tell
you.”

“Oh
the world with you and never be dull. You are one of those delightful
women in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk. Now
please don’t fret over your son; you can’t expect never to be parted.”

Madame Karenina stood quite still
eyes were smiling.

“Anna Arkadyevna
little son eight years old
from him before

“Yes
and she of hers
her face

“I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored
promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But
apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain
and she turned to the old countess.

“Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-bye
countess.”

“Good-bye
pretty face. I speak plainly
I’ve lost my heart to you.”

Stereotyped as the phrase was
and was delighted by it. She flushed
cheek to the countess’s lips
smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes
Vronsky. He pressed the little hand she gave him
though at something special
freely and vigorously shook his hand. She went out with the rapid step
which bore her rather fully-developed figure with such strange
lightness.

“Very charming

That was just what her son was thinking. His eyes followed her till her
graceful figure was out of sight

annoyed.

“Well
mother.

“Everything has been delightful. Alexander has been very good
Marie has grown very pretty. She’s very interesting.”

And she began telling him again of what interested her most—the
christening of her grandson

“Here’s Lavrenty

The old butler
carriage to announce that everything was ready
to go.

“Come; there’s not such a crowd now

The maid took a handbag and the lap dog
other baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were
getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with
panic-stricken faces. The station-master
extraordinary colored cap. Obviously something unusual had happened.
The crowd who had left the train were running back again.

“What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...” was heard
among the crowd. Stepan Arkadyevitch
turned back. They too looked scared
to avoid the crowd.

The ladies got in
crowd to find out details of the disaster.

A guard
not heard the train moving back

Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from
the butler.

Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky was
evidently upset. He frowned and seemed ready to cry.

“Ah

Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious
composed.

“Oh
wife was there.... It was awful to see her!... She flung herself on the
body. They say he was the only support of an immense family. How
awful!”

“Couldn’t one do anything for her?” said Madame Karenina in an agitated
whisper.

Vronsky glanced at her

“I’ll be back directly
doorway.

When he came back a few minutes later
in conversation with the countess about the new singer
countess was impatiently looking towards the door

“Now let us be off
Vronsky was in front with his mother. Behind walked Madame Karenina
with her brother. Just as they were going out of the station the
station-master overtook Vronsky.

“You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly explain
for whose benefit you intend them?”

“For the widow
thought there was no need to ask.”

“You gave that?” cried Oblonsky
hand
Good-bye

And he and his sister stood still

When they went out the Vronsky’s carriage had already driven away.
People coming in were still talking of what happened.

“What a horrible death!” said a gentleman
cut in two pieces.”

“On the contrary
another.

“How is it they don’t take proper precautions?” said a third.

Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage
saw with surprise that her lips were quivering
difficulty restraining her tears.

“What is it

“It’s an omen of evil

“What nonsense!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “You’ve come
chief thing. You can’t conceive how I’m resting my hopes on you.”

“Have you known Vronsky long?” she asked.

“Yes. You know we’re hoping he will marry Kitty.”

“Yes?” said Anna softly. “Come now
tossing her head
superfluous oppressing her. “Let us talk of your affairs. I got your
letter

“Yes

“Well

And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.

On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out

When Anna went into the room

before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister

Dolly was crushed by her sorrow

sister-in-law was coming. “And

I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards
myself.” It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at
Petersburg at the Karenins’
there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family
life. “But why should I not receive her? If only she doesn’t take it
into her head to console me!” thought Dolly. “All consolation and
counsel and Christian forgiveness

All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want
to talk of her sorrow

She took off her kerchief and her hat

“You are radiant with health and happiness!” said Dolly

“I?... Yes

She took her in her arms and kissed her. “Delightful child
Show me them all.”

She mentioned them

but appreciate that.

“Very well

After seeing the children

from her.

“Dolly

Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of
conventional sympathy

“Dolly
try to comfort you; that’s impossible. But
sorry from my heart for you!”

Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered.
She moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous
little hand. Dolly did not shrink away
frigid expression. She said:

“To comfort me’s impossible. Everything’s lost after what has happened
everything’s over!”

And directly she had said this
the wasted

“But

“All’s over

“Dolly
tell me about it.”

Dolly looked at her inquiringly.

Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna’s face.

“Very well

“Oh
said Anna

“And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?”
Dolly resumed. “Not the slightest! He’s happy and contented.”

“Oh
down by remorse....”

“Is he capable of remorse?” Dolly interrupted
sister-in-law’s face.

“Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry for
him. We both know him. He’s good-hearted
so humiliated. What touched me most....” (and here Anna guessed what
would touch Dolly most) “he’s tortured by two things: that he’s ashamed

her words.

“Yes

again after her? For me to live with him now would be torture

And sobs cut short her words. But as though of set design
she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.

“She’s young

Again her eyes glowed with hatred.

“And after that he will tell me.... What! can I believe him? Never! No

The whole of that day Anna spent at home
Oblonskys’
already heard of her arrival
the whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent a brief
note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.
“Come

Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general

“Next week

“Why

“It’s strange

“No

“How can _you_ be dull at a ball?”

“Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?” inquired Anna.

Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.

“Because you always look nicer than anyone.”

Anna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed a little

“In the first place it’s never so; and secondly
difference would it make to me?”

“Are you coming to this ball?” asked Kitty.

“I imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going. Here

“I know something. Stiva told me
so much

“Oh
you?”

“Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I traveled

“What did his mother tell you?”

“Oh
how chivalrous he is.... Well

the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.

But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some
reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt that there
was something that had to do with her in it
not to have been.

“She pressed me very much to go and see her

Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people. Stepan
Arkadyevitch did not come out. He must have left his wife’s room by the
other door.

“It will be lighter for you here

“I assure you that I sleep everywhere

“What’s the question?” inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch

From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken
place.

“I want to move Anna downstairs

“God knows whether they are fully reconciled

“Oh
husband. “Come

“Yes

“I know how you do everything

Dolly’s lips as she spoke.

“Full
rejoicing that she was the cause of it
her.

“Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch

The whole evening Dolly was
her husband
so as to seem as though
offense.

At half-past nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family
conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys’ was broken up by an
apparently simple incident. But this simple incident for some reason
struck everyone as strange. Talking about common acquaintances in
Petersburg

“She is in my album
Seryozha

Towards ten o’clock
often before going to a ball put him to bed herself
at being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about
coming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha. She longed to look
at his photograph and talk of him. Seizing the first pretext
up
to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.

Just as she was leaving the drawing-room

“Who can that be?” said Dolly.

“It’s early for me to be fetched
observed Kitty.

“Sure to be someone with papers for me
When Anna was passing the top of the staircase
up to announce the visitor
under a lamp. Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky
strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something
stirred in her heart. He was standing still
pulling something out of his pocket. At the instant when she was just
facing the stairs
the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and
dismay. With a slight inclination of her head she passed
behind her Stepan Arkadyevitch’s loud voice calling him to come up
the quiet

When Anna returned with the album
Arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the
dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.
“And nothing would induce him to come up. What a queer fellow he is!”
added Stepan Arkadyevitch.

Kitty blushed. She thought that she was the only person who knew why he
had come
thought
not come up because he thought it late

All of them looked at each other
Anna’s album.

There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man’s calling at
half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner
party and not coming in
all


Chapter 22

The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the
great staircase
in powder and red coats. From the rooms came a constant
from a hive
between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before
the mirror

When
tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash
back a little. She felt that everything must be right of itself

It was one of Kitty’s best days. Her dress was not uncomfortable
anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not
crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high
did not pinch
chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair. All the three
buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her
hand without concealing its lines. The black velvet of her locket
nestled with special softness round her neck. That velvet was
delicious; at home
felt that that velvet was speaking. About all the rest there might be a
doubt

gave Kitty a sense of chill marble
Her eyes sparkled
the consciousness of her own attractiveness. She had scarcely entered
the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies

that throng—when she was asked for a waltz
partner

Korsunsky. He had only just left the Countess Bonina

“It’s a rest to waltz with you
first slow steps of the waltz. “It’s exquisite—such lightness
precision.” He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his
partners whom he knew well.

She smiled at his praise
shoulder. She was not like a girl at her first ball
in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. And she was not a
girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the
ballroom was familiar and tiresome. But she was in the middle stage
between these two; she was excited
sufficient self-possession to be able to observe. In the left corner of
the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.
There—incredibly naked—was the beauty Lidi
the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin
be found where the best people were. In that direction gazed the young
men
there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet
gown. And _he_ was there. Kitty had not seen him since the evening she
refused Levin. With her long-sighted eyes
was even aware that he was looking at her.

“Another turn
breath.

“No

“Where shall I take you?”

“Madame Karenina’s here

“Wherever you command.”

And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the
group in the left corner

Her coiffure was not striking. All that was noticeable was the little
wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about
her neck and temples. Round her well-cut
pearls.

Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her
her invariably in lilac. But now seeing her in black
had not fully seen her charm. She saw her now as someone quite new and
surprising to her. Now she understood that Anna could not have been in

She was standing holding herself

“No

At that instant Vronsky came up.

“Well

“What is she vexed with him about?” thought Kitty
had intentionally not responded to Vronsky’s bow. Vronsky went up to
Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille
that he had not seen her all this time. Kitty gazed in admiration at
Anna waltzing

suddenly stopped. Kitty looked into his face

“_Pardon! pardon!_ Waltz! waltz!” shouted Korsunsky from the other side
of the room
dancing himself.


Chapter 23

Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room. After the first
waltz Kitty went to her mother
words to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first
quadrille. During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said:
there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys

touched her to the quick
here
much from the quadrille. She looked forward with a thrill at her heart
to the mazurka. She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be
decided. The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the
mazurka did not trouble her. She felt sure she would dance the mazurka
with him as she had done at former balls
saying she was engaged for the mazurka. The whole ball up to the last
quadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors
sounds
begged for a rest. But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one
of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse
_vis-à-vis_ with Vronsky and Anna. She had not been near Anna again
since the beginning of the evening
quite new and surprising. She saw in her the signs of that excitement
of success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was
intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting. She knew
that feeling and knew its signs
quivering
excitement unconsciously playing on her lips
precision

“Who?” she asked herself. “All or one?” And not assisting the harassed
young man she was dancing with in the conversation
he had lost and could not pick up again
liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into
the _grand rond_
kept watch with a growing pang at her heart. “No
admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her
And that one? can it be he?” Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous
light flashed into her eyes
lips. she seemed to make an effort to control herself
show these signs of delight
themselves. “But what of him?” Kitty looked at him and was filled with
terror. What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna’s
face she saw in him. What had become of his always self-possessed
resolute manner
every time he turned to her
fallen at her feet
submission and dread. “I would not offend you

On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.

They were speaking of common acquaintances

actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French

it has done wrong.

Anna smiled
and he became serious. Some supernatural force drew Kitty’s eyes to
Anna’s face. She was fascinating in her simple black dress

“Yes

his brother’s lodgings. “And I don’t get on with other people. Pride
they say. No
put myself in such a position.” And he pictured to himself Vronsky
happy
in the awful position in which he had been that evening. “Yes

went out to dinner
his brother’s address

the facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay’s life. He remembered
how his brother

people

recalled the scandal with a sharper

night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street. He remembered
the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother

Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it
inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay

Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage

far from encouraging him
others. They had teased him
had broken out
from him with horror and disgust.

Levin felt that
Nikolay

having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited
intelligence. But he had always wanted to be good. “I will tell him
everything

resolved to himself
of which he had the address.

“At the top

“At home?”

“Sure to be at home.”

The door of No. 12 was half open
light thick fumes of cheap
unknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he
heard his cough.

As he went in the door

“It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing’s done.”

Konstantin Levin looked in at the door
young man with an immense shock of hair
that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown
sitting on the sofa. His brother was not to be seen. Konstantin felt a
sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which
his brother spent his life. No one had heard him
taking off his galoshes
was saying. He was speaking of some enterprise.

“Well
voice responded
if there’s any left; or else go and get some.”

The woman rose

“There’s some gentleman

“Whom do you want?” said the voice of Nikolay Levin

“It’s I

“Who’s _I_?” Nikolay’s voice said again
be heard getting up hurriedly

thin
in its weirdness and sickliness.

He was even thinner than three years before
seen him last. He was wearing a short coat
seemed huger than ever. His hair had grown thinner
mustaches hid his lips
his visitor.

“Ah
eyes lit up with joy. But the same second he looked round at the young
man
knew so well
expression

“I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don’t know you and
don’t want to know you. What is it you want?”

He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him. The
worst and most tiresome part of his character
with him so difficult
thought of him
nervous twitching of his head

“I didn’t want to see you for anything
simply come to see you.”

His brother’s timidity obviously softened Nikolay. His lips twitched.

“Oh
supper? Masha
who this is?” he said
gentleman in the jerkin: “This is Mr. Kritsky
very remarkable man. He’s persecuted by the police
he’s not a scoundrel.”

And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.
Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go
shouted to her
express himself
began
Kritsky’s story: how he had been expelled from the university for
starting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools;
and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school
he had been driven out of that too
for something.

“You’re of the Kiev university?” said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky
break the awkward silence that followed.

“Yes

“And this woman
the partner of my life
house
her
knitting his brows
same as my wife
And if you think you’re lowering yourself
there’s the door.”

And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.

“Why I should be lowering myself

“Then
wine.... No


Chapter 25

“So you see
and twitching.

It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.

“Here
together with strings
That’s the beginning of a new thing we’re going into. It’s a productive
association....”

Konstantin scarcely heard him. He looked into his sickly
face
himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the
association. He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him
from self-contempt. Nikolay Levin went on talking:

“You know that capital oppresses the laborer. The laborers with us
peasants
much they work they can’t escape from their position of beasts of
burden. All the profits of labor
position
all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists. And
society’s so constituted that the harder they work
profit of the merchants and landowners
burden to the end. And that state of things must be changed
finished up

“Yes
come out on his brother’s projecting cheekbones.

“And so we’re founding a locksmiths’ association
production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be
in common.”

“Where is the association to be?” asked Konstantin Levin.

“In the village of Vozdrem

“But why in a village? In the villages
work as it is. Why a locksmiths’ association in a village?”

“Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were
and that’s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don’t like people to try and
get them out of their slavery
objection.

Konstantin Levin sighed
dirty room. This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.

“I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch’s aristocratic views. I know that he
applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.”

“No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?” said Levin
smiling.

“Sergey Ivanovitch? I’ll tell you what for!” Nikolay Levin shrieked
suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch. “I’ll tell you what for....
But what’s the use of talking? There’s only one thing.... What did you
come to me for? You look down on this
away
“And go away

“I don’t look down on it at all
don’t even dispute it.”

At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back. Nikolay Levin looked round
angrily at her. She went quickly to him

“I’m not well; I’ve grown irritable
calmer and breathing painfully; “and then you talk to me of Sergey
Ivanovitch and his article. It’s such rubbish
self-deception. What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of
it? Have you read his article?” he asked Kritsky
the table
as to clear a space.

“I’ve not read it
to enter into the conversation.

“Why not?” said Nikolay Levin
Kritsky.

“Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it.”

“Oh
That article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s over their
heads. But with me
know where its weakness lies.”

Everyone was mute. Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.

“Won’t you have supper? All right
the locksmith.”

Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.

“He’s no good either

But at that instant Kritsky

“What do you want now?” he said
Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna

“Have you been long with my brother?” he said to her.

“Yes
poor. Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal

“That is ... how does he drink?”

“Drinks vodka

“And a great deal?” whispered Levin.

“Yes
Levin had reappeared.

“What were you talking about?” he said
his scared eyes from one to the other. “What was it?”

“Oh

“Oh
her. She’s a wench
neck. “You understand everything
everything
again

“Nikolay Dmitrievitch
Nikolaevna

“Oh
he said
angrily
drank it greedily. “Like a drink?” he turned to his brother
once became better humored.

“Well
all’s said and done
what you’re doing
pouring out another glassful. “How are you living?”

“I live alone in the country
land
which his brother ate and drank
it.

“Why don’t you get married?”

“It hasn’t happened so

“Why not? For me now ... everything’s at an end! I’ve made a mess of my
life. But this I’ve said
given me when I needed it

Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.

“Do you know your little Vanya’s with me
at Pokrovskoe.”

Nikolay jerked his neck

“Yes
still
gardener
and don’t alter anything in the house
and make everything as it used to be again. Then I’ll come and see you
if your wife is nice.”

“But come to me now

“I’d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey
Ivanovitch.”

“You wouldn’t find him there. I live quite independently of him.”

“Yes
him

This timidity touched Konstantin.

“If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject
that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side. You’re
both wrong. You’re more wrong externally

“Ah

“But I personally value friendly relations with you more because....”

“Why

Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was
unhappy
he meant to say

“Enough
her plump

“Let it be! Don’t insist! I’ll beat you!” he shouted.

Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile
once reflected on Nikolay’s face

“And do you suppose she understands nothing?” said Nikolay. “She
understands it all better than any of us. Isn’t it true there’s
something good and sweet in her?”

“Were you never before in Moscow?” Konstantin said to her
of saying something.

“Only you mustn’t be polite and stiff with her. It frightens her. No
one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her
for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame. Mercy on us
senselessness in the world!” he cried suddenly. “These new
institutions
hideousness it all is!”

And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.

Konstantin Levin heard him
public institutions
distasteful to him now from his brother’s lips.

“In another world we shall understand it all

“In another world! Ah
he said
would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess
and other people’s
awfully afraid of death.” He shuddered. “But do drink something. Would
you like some champagne? Or shall we go somewhere? Let’s go to the
Gypsies! Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian
songs.”

His speech had begun to falter
to another. Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go
out anywhere

Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need
Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother.

anyone else. All he wanted now was to be better than before. In the
first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for
any extraordinary happiness
consequently he would not so disdain what he really had. Secondly
would never again let himself give way to low passion
which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make
an offer. Then remembering his brother Nikolay
that he would never allow himself to forget him

The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in. The familiar

like a gymnast

The bailiff came in
but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been
a little scorched. This piece of news irritated Levin. The new drying
machine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin. The bailiff
had always been against the drying machine
suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been
scorched. Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been
scorched
which he had hundreds of times given orders. He was annoyed
reprimanded the bailiff. But there had been an important and joyful
event: Pava

This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his

back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing-room.

The house was big and old-fashioned
had the whole house heated and used. He knew that this was stupid
knew that it was positively not right
plans
which his father and mother had lived and died. They had lived just the
life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection
dreamed of beginning with his wife

Levin scarcely remembered his mother. His conception of her was for him
a sacred memory
a repetition of that exquisite
had been.

He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage
that he positively pictured to himself first the family
secondarily the woman who would give him a family. His ideas of
marriage were
of his acquaintances
facts of social life. For Levin it was the chief affair of life
which its whole happiness turned. And now he had to give up that.

joyful thought: “In two years’ time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava
herself will perhaps still be alive
and the three others—how lovely!”

He took up his book again. “Very good
same thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the
other in the equation for the solution of any problem? No. Well
what of it? The connection between all the forces of nature is felt

Levin looked intently at her

Still in the same anxious frame of mind

the feeling of shame was intensified
at the point when she thought of Vronsky

look it straight in the face? Why
me and this officer boy there exist
than such as are common with every acquaintance?” She laughed
contemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely
unable to follow what she read. She passed the paper-knife over the
window pane
almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without
cause came over her. She felt as though her nerves were strings being
strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg. She felt her
eyes opening wider and wider

seemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her with unaccustomed
vividness. Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her

a stranger. “What’s that on the arm of the chair

afraid of giving way to this delirium. But something drew her towards

though someone were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding
dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and
hide everything. Anna felt as though she were sinking down. But it was
not terrible

together; she realized that they had reached a station and that this

with her over the door. But she enjoyed the struggle.

She opened the door and went out. The wind seemed as though lying in
wait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear
her off

had been powerful on the steps

she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride. She had no need to ask why
he had come. She knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was
here to be where she was.

“I didn’t know you were going. What are you coming for?” she said
letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post. And
irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.

Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night. He sat in his
armchair
and out. If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed
people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure
seemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever. He looked at
people as if they were things. A nervous young man

When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg
of rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.

Petritsky was a young lieutenant
not merely not wealthy
he was always drunk
ludicrous and disgraceful scandals
comrades and his superior officers. On arriving at twelve o’clock from
the station at his flat
carriage familiar to him. While still outside his own door
he heard masculine laughter
Petritsky’s voice. “If that’s one of the villains

Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty
woman
dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.
In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed
classes. One
ridiculous people
one wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent
a woman modest
ought to bring up one’s children
debts; and various similar absurdities. This was the class of
old-fashioned and ridiculous people. But there was another class of
people

oneself without a blush to every passion
else.

the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in

Petersburg life that he was used to.

“Impossible!” he cried

the ambassador. They see our friend standing there.” (Petritsky
mimicked how he was standing with the helmet.) “The Grand Duchess asked
him to give her the helmet; he doesn’t give it to her. What do you
think of that? Well

PART TWO


Chapter 1

At the end of the winter
was being held
and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength. She had
been ill

he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely
as a relic of barbarism

There was nothing for it but to submit

knowledge

the celebrated doctor
standing in the drawing-room talking to the prince. The prince frowned
and coughed
of life
medicine
he was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty’s
illness. “Conceited blockhead!” he thought
celebrated doctor’s chatter about his daughter’s symptoms. The doctor
was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt
for this old gentleman
of his intelligence. He perceived that it was no good talking to the
old man
Before her he decided to scatter his pearls. At that instant the
princess came into the drawing-room with the family doctor. The prince
withdrew
performance. The princess was distracted
She felt she had sinned against Kitty.

“Well
everything.”

“Is there hope?” she meant to say
not utter the question. “Well

“Immediately
I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.”

“So we had better leave you?”

“As you please.”

The princess went out with a sigh.

When the doctors were left alone
explaining his opinion
trouble
in the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch.

“Yes

The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his
observations.

“The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not
aware
definite. But we may suspect it. And there are indications;
malnutrition

“But

“Yes
again glancing at his watch. “Beg pardon
yet
then I can do it in twenty minutes. So we were saying the problem may
be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves. The
one is in close connection with the other
at once.”

“And how about a tour abroad?” asked the family doctor.

“I’ve no liking for foreign tours. And take note: if there is an early
stage of tuberculous process
tour will be of no use. What is wanted is means of improving nutrition
and not for lowering it.” And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan
of treatment with Soden waters
on the ground that they could do no harm.

The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.

“But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits
removal from conditions calling up reminiscences. And then the mother
wishes it

“Ah! Well
quacks are mischievous.... They ought to be persuaded.... Well
them go then.”

He glanced once more at his watch.

“Oh! time’s up already
announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated
his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.

“What! another examination!” cried the mother

“Oh

“Come this way.”

And the mother
to Kitty. Wasted and flushed
there by the agony of shame she had been put through
the middle of the room. When the doctor came in she flushed crimson
and her eyes filled with tears. All her illness and treatment struck
her as a thing so stupid
as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase. Her heart
was broken. Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders? But
she could not grieve her mother
herself to blame.

“May I trouble you to sit down
to her.

He sat down with a smile
asking her tiresome questions. She answered him
up

“Excuse me
third time you’ve asked me the same thing.”

The celebrated doctor did not take offense.

“Nervous irritability
the room. “However

And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess
exceptionally intelligent woman
and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters
certainly harmless. At the question: Should they go abroad? the doctor
plunged into deep meditation
Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad
no faith in foreign quacks

It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after
the doctor had gone. The mother was much more cheerful when she went
back to her daughter
often

“Really
go!” she said
she began talking of the preparations for the journey.


Chapter 2

Soon after the doctor
a consultation that day
confinement (she had another baby
the winter)
had left her tiny baby and a sick child
which was to be decided that day.

“Well
off her hat. “You’re all in good spirits. Good news

They tried to tell her what the doctor had said
though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length
was utterly impossible to report what he had said. The only point of
interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.

Dolly could not help sighing. Her dearest friend
away. And her life was not a cheerful one. Her relations with Stepan
Arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating. The
union Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character
family harmony was breaking down again at the same point. There had
been nothing definite
money
tortured by suspicions of infidelity
dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already. The
first onslaught of jealousy
again
her as it had the first time. Such a discovery now would only mean
breaking up family habits
him and still more herself
her large family was a constant worry to her: first
young baby did not go well
the children had fallen ill.

“Well

“Ah
afraid it’s scarlatina. I have come here now to hear about Kitty
then I shall shut myself up entirely
scarlatina.”

The old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor’s
departure
words to her

“How have you settled it? you’re going? Well
do with me?”

“I suppose you had better stay here

“That’s as you like.”

“Mamma
nicer for him and for us too.”

The old prince got up and stroked Kitty’s hair. She lifted her head and
looked at him with a forced smile. It always seemed to her that he
understood her better than anyone in the family
much about her. Being the youngest
she fancied that his love gave him insight. When now her glance met his
blue kindly eyes looking intently at her
right through her
passing within her. Reddening
a kiss

“These stupid chignons! There’s no getting at the real daughter. One
simply strokes the bristles of dead women. Well
his elder daughter

“Nothing
meant. “He’s always out; I scarcely ever see him
adding with a sarcastic smile.

“Why
forest?”

“No

“Oh
a journey too? At your service
“And I tell you what
must wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why
merry
frost. Hey?”

What her father said seemed simple enough
became confused and overcome like a detected criminal. “Yes
all
though I’m ashamed
spirit to make any answer. She tried to begin
into tears

“See what comes of your jokes!” the princess pounced down on her
husband. “You’re always....” she began a string of reproaches.

The prince listened to the princess’s scolding rather a long while
without speaking

“She’s so much to be pitied
don’t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the
cause of it. Ah! to be so mistaken in people!” said the princess
by the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was
speaking of Vronsky. “I don’t know why there aren’t laws against such
base

“Ah
from his low chair
the doorway. “There are laws
it
nobody else. Laws against such young gallants there have always been
and there still are! Yes
have been
young dandy. Yes

The prince apparently had plenty more to say
princess heard his tone she subsided at once
she always did on serious occasions.

“Alexander
weep.

As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down. He went up to
her.

“There
can’t be helped. There’s no great harm done. God is merciful ...
thanks....” he said
the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand. And the
prince went out of the room.

Before this
with her motherly
woman’s work lay before her
her hat
action. While her mother was attacking her father
restrain her mother
prince’s outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother
tender towards her father for so quickly being kind again. But when her
father left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful—to
go to Kitty and console her.

“I’d been meaning to tell you something for a long while
you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the
last time? He told Stiva so.”

“Well

“So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?... She didn’t tell you so?”

“No
proud. But I know it’s all on account of the other.”

“Yes
him if it hadn’t been for the other
her so horribly.”

It was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned
against her daughter

“Oh
way

“Mamma

“Well


Chapter 3

When she went into Kitty’s little room
full of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe
and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago
they had decorated the room the year before together
and gaiety. Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low
chair near the door
Kitty glanced at her sister
expression of her face did not change.

“I’m just going now
to come to see me
talk to you.”

“What about?” Kitty asked swiftly

“What should it be

“I have no trouble.”

“Nonsense
it. And believe me
through it.”

Kitty did not speak

“He’s not worth your grieving over him
coming straight to the point.

“No
breaking voice. “Don’t talk of it! Please

“But who can have told you so? No one has said that. I’m certain he was
in love with you

“Oh
Kitty
flushed crimson
her belt first with one hand and then with the other. Dolly knew this
trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited;
she knew
forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much
have soothed her

“What
“That I’ve been in love with a man who didn’t care a straw for me
that I’m dying of love for him? And this is said to me by my own
sister
me!... I don’t want these condolences and humbug!”

“Kitty

“Why are you tormenting me?”

“But I ... quite the contrary ... I see you’re unhappy....”

But Kitty in her fury did not hear her.

“I’ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about. I am too proud
ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.”

“Yes
said Darya Alexandrovna
speak to you?...”

The mention of Levin’s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige
of self-control. She leaped up from her chair
on the ground

“Why bring Levin in too? I can’t understand what you want to torment me
for. I’ve told you
never
deceived you
You may

And saying these words she glanced at her sister
sat silent
the room as she had meant to do
face in her handkerchief.

The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself. That
humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a
peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it. She had not
looked for such cruelty in her sister
suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt
heart-rending
was on her knees before her.

“Dolinka
sweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna’s skirt.

As though tears were the indispensable oil
of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters
the sisters after their tears talked
their minds
understood each other. Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in
anger about her husband’s infidelity and her humiliating position had
cut her poor sister to the heart
for her part knew all she had wanted to find out. She felt certain that
her surmises were correct; that Kitty’s misery
misery
and she had refused him
fully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky. Kitty said not a
word of that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.

“I have nothing to make me miserable
can you understand that everything has become hateful
coarse to me
loathsome thoughts I have about everything.”

“Why

“The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can’t tell you. It’s not
unhappiness
was good in me was all hidden away
loathsome. Come
look in her sister’s eyes. “Father began saying something to me just
now.... It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married. Mother
takes me to a ball: it seems to me she only takes me to get me married
off as soon as may be
I can’t drive away such thoughts. Eligible suitors
can’t bear to see them. It seems to me they’re taking stock of me and
summing me up. In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple
joy to me
The doctor.... Then....” Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further
that ever since this change had taken place in her
had become insufferably repulsive to her
him without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her
imagination.

“Oh
loathsome light
off.”

“But you mustn’t think about it.”

“I can’t help it. I’m never happy except with the children at your
house.”

“What a pity you can’t be with me!”

“Oh
let me.”

Kitty insisted on having her way
nursed the children all through the scarlatina
turned out to be. The two sisters brought all the six children
successfully through it
the Shtcherbatskys went abroad.


Chapter 4

The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows
everyone else
has its subdivisions. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close
ties in three different circles of this highest society. One circle was
her husband’s government official set
subordinates
manner
difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence
which she had at first entertained for these persons. Now she knew all
of them as people know one another in a country town; she knew their
habits and weaknesses
knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities
knew who was for whom
where they agreed and disagreed. But the circle of political
interests had never interested her
Ivanovna’s influence

Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one
by means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career. The center
of this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. It was a set made up of
elderly
ambitious men. One of the clever people belonging to the set had called
it “the conscience of Petersburg society.” Alexey Alexandrovitch had
the highest esteem for this circle
getting on with everyone
Petersburg made friends in this circle also. Now
Moscow
that both she and all of them were insincere
ill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia
Ivanovna as little as possible.

The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the
fashionable world—the world of balls
the world that hung on to the court with one hand
sinking to the level of the demi-monde. For the demi-monde the members
of that fashionable world believed that they despised

“When I’m old and ugly I’ll be the same

Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya’s
world
besides in her heart she preferred the first circle. But since her
visit to Moscow she had done quite the contrary. She avoided her
serious-minded friends
she met Vronsky
She met Vronsky specially often at Betsy’s for Betsy was a Vronsky by
birth and his cousin. Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of
meeting Anna

day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time. She
was conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved

At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for
daring to pursue her. Soon after her return from Moscow

“Why didn’t you come to dinner?” she said to him. “I marvel at the
second sight of lovers

Vronsky looked inquiringly at her. She nodded. He thanked her by a
smile

“But how I remember your jeers!” continued Princess Betsy

“What’s become of all that? You’re caught

“That’s my one desire

I’m not caught enough

He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the

“But why was it you didn’t come to dinner?” she said

“I must tell you about that. I was busily employed

never guess. I’ve been reconciling a husband with a man who’d insulted
his wife. Yes

“Well

“Almost.”

“You really must tell me about it
in the next _entr’acte._”

“I can’t; I’m going to the French theater.”

“From Nilsson?” Betsy queried in horror

“Can’t help it. I’ve an appointment there

They talked it over

greatly to the softening of the injured husband’s feelings.

Princess Betsy drove home from the theater

Almost at the same instant the hostess

The hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves. Chairs were

conversation wavered
broken up by meetings
feeling about for something to rest upon.

“She’s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she’s studied

“Oh
anything new about her

the middle between the two groups
the conversation first of one and then of the other. “Three people have
used that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already
though they had made a compact about it. And I can’t see why they liked
that remark so.”

The conversation was cut short by this observation
had to be thought of again.

“Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful
wife
by the English _small talk_. She addressed the attaché
loss now what to begin upon.

“They say that that’s a difficult task
isn’t spiteful
subject. It all lies in the subject. If a subject’s given me
to spin something round it. I often think that the celebrated talkers
of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now.
Everything clever is so stale....”

“That has been said long ago
laughing.

The conversation began amiably
came to a stop again. They had to have recourse to the sure
never-failing topic—gossip.

“Don’t you think there’s something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch?” he
said
the table.

“Oh
is he’s so often here.”

This conversation was maintained
could not be talked of in that room—that is to say
Tushkevitch with their hostess.

Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile
vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the
latest piece of public news
finally to rest on the last topic

“Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman—the mother
daughter—has ordered a costume in _diable rose_ color?”

“Nonsense! No

“I wonder that with her sense—for she’s not a fool
doesn’t see how funny she is.”

Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless
Madame Maltishtcheva
burning faggot-stack.

The husband of Princess Betsy
collector of engravings
the drawing-room before going to his club. Stepping noiselessly over
the thick rugs

“How did you like Nilsson?” he asked.

“Oh
responded. “Please don’t talk to me about the opera; you know nothing
about music. I’d better meet you on your own ground
your maiolica and engravings. Come now
buying lately at the old curiosity shops?”

“Would you like me to show you? But you don’t understand such things.”

“Oh
names?... the bankers ... they’ve some splendid engravings. They showed
them to us.”

“Why
samovar.

“Yes
the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds
speaking loudly
sauce it was
sauce for eighteen pence
I can’t run to hundred-pound sauces.”

“She’s unique!” said the lady of the house.

“Marvelous!” said someone.

The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya’s speeches was always
unique
that though she spoke not always appropriately
things with some sense in them. In the society in which she lived such
plain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram. Princess
Myakaya could never see why it had that effect
and took advantage of it.

As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke
conversation around the ambassador’s wife had dropped
tried to bring the whole party together
wife.

“Will you really not have tea? You should come over here by us.”

“No
smile

It was a very agreeable conversation. They were criticizing the
Karenins

“Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There’s something
strange about her

“The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of
Alexey Vronsky

“Well
shadow
something. I never could understand how it was a punishment. But a
woman must dislike being without a shadow.”

“Yes
friend.

“Bad luck to your tongue!” said Princess Myakaya suddenly. “Madame
Karenina’s a splendid woman. I don’t like her husband
very much.”

“Why don’t you like her husband? He’s such a remarkable man
ambassador’s wife. “My husband says there are few statesmen like him in
Europe.”

“And my husband tells me just the same
Princess Myakaya. “If our husbands didn’t talk to us
facts as they are. Alexey Alexandrovitch
fool. I say it in a whisper ... but doesn’t it really make everything
clear? Before
for his ability
directly I said
explained

“How spiteful you are today!”

“Not a bit. I’d no other way out of it. One of the two had to be a
fool. And

“‘No one is satisfied with his fortune
his wit.’” The attaché repeated the French saying.

“That’s just it
point is that I won’t abandon Anna to your mercies. She’s so nice
charming. How can she help it if they’re all in love with her
follow her about like shadows?”

“Oh
self-defense.

“If no one follows us about like a shadow
any right to blame her.”

And having duly disposed of Anna’s friend
and together with the ambassador’s wife
where the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia.

“What wicked gossip were you talking over there?” asked Betsy.

“About the Karenins. The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey
Alexandrovitch
down at the table.

“Pity we didn’t hear it!” said Princess Betsy
door. “Ah
Vronsky

Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was
meeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the
quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one
has only just parted.

“Where do I come from?” he said
ambassador’s wife. “Well
the _opera bouffe_. I do believe I’ve seen it a hundred times
always with fresh enjoyment. It’s exquisite! I know it’s disgraceful
but I go to sleep at the opera
last minute

He mentioned a French actress
her; but the ambassador’s wife

“Please don’t tell us about that horror.”

“All right

“And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct
thing

Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her.

She acknowledged this only by a slight nod

shaking the hands proffered to her

“I have been at Countess Lidia’s
but I stayed on. Sir John was there. He’s very interesting.”

“Oh

“Yes; he told us about the life in India

The conversation
the light of a lamp being blown out.

“Sir John! Yes
girl’s quite in love with him.”

“And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl’s to marry Topov?”

“Yes

“I wonder at the parents! They say it’s a marriage for love.”

“For love? What antediluvian notions you have! Can one talk of love in
these days?” said the ambassador’s wife.

“What’s to be done? It’s a foolish old fashion that’s kept up still
said Vronsky.

“So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion. The only happy
marriages I know are marriages of prudence.”

“Yes
away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have
refused to recognize

“But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have
sown their wild oats already. That’s like scarlatina—one has to go
through it and get it over.”

“Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love

“I was in love in my young days with a deacon
Myakaya. “I don’t know that it did me any good.”

“No; I imagine
and then correct them

“Even after marriage?” said the ambassador’s wife playfully.

“‘It’s never too late to mend.’” The attaché repeated the English
proverb.

“Just so
do you think about it?” she turned to Anna
perceptible resolute smile on her lips
conversation.

“I think
think ... of so many men
many kinds of love.”

Vronsky was gazing at Anna
she would say. He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered
these words.

Anna suddenly turned to him.

“Oh
Shtcherbatskaya’s very ill.”

“Really?” said Vronsky

Anna looked sternly at him.

“That doesn’t interest you?”

“On the contrary
you

Anna got up and went to Betsy.

“Give me a cup of tea

While Betsy was pouring out the tea

“What is it they write to you?” he repeated.

“I often think men have no understanding of what’s not honorable though
they’re always talking of it

away

“I don’t quite understand the meaning of your words

She glanced towards the sofa beside her

“Yes
“You behaved wrongly

“Do you suppose I don’t know that I’ve acted wrongly? But who was the
cause of my doing so?”

“What do you say that to me for?” she said

“You know what for
glance and not dropping his eyes.

Not he

“That only shows you have no heart
she knew he had a heart

“What you spoke of just now was a mistake

“Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word

very word “forbidden” she had shown that she acknowledged certain
rights over him

resolutely into his eyes
her cheeks. “I’ve come on purpose this evening
you. I have come to tell you that this must end. I have never blushed
before anyone

He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.

“What do you wish of me?” he said simply and seriously.

“I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty’s forgiveness

“You don’t wish that?” he said.

He saw she was saying what she forced herself to say
wanted to say.

“If you love me
peace.”

His face grew radiant.

“Don’t you know that you’re all my life to me? But I know no peace
I can’t give it to you; all myself—and love ... yes. I can’t think of
you and myself apart. You and I are one to me. And I see no chance
before us of peace for me or for you. I see a chance of despair
wretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss
there’s no chance of it?” he murmured with his lips; but she heard.

She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said. But
instead of that she let her eyes rest on him
answer.

“It’s come!” he thought in ecstasy. “When I was beginning to despair
and it seemed there would be no end—it’s come! She loves me! She owns
it!”

“Then do this for me: never say such things to me
friends

“Friends we shall never be
the happiest or the wretchedest of people—that’s in your hands.”

She would have said something

“I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope
But if even that cannot be
You shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you.”

“I don’t want to drive you away.”

“Only don’t change anything

At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room

“Your Rambouillet is in full conclave

though that were a disturbing fact. Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only
person who did not once look in that direction
from the interesting discussion he had entered upon.

Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone
Princess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey
Alexandrovitch

“I’m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband’s
language

“Oh

Chapter 8

Alexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact
that his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart
conversation with him about something. But he noticed that to the rest
of the party this appeared something striking and improper
that reason it seemed to him too to be improper. He made up his mind
that he must speak of it to his wife.

On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study
did
the place where he had laid the paper-knife in it
o’clock
high forehead and shook his head
his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night. Anna
Arkadyevna had not yet come in. With a book under his arm he went
upstairs. But this evening
meditations upon official details
wife and something disagreeable connected with her. Contrary to his
usual habit
the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back. He could not go to
bed
thoroughly over the position that had just arisen.

When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to
his wife about it
now
itself

Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous. Jealousy according to his
notions was an insult to one’s wife
in one’s wife. Why one ought to have confidence—that is to say
complete conviction that his young wife would always love him—he did
not ask himself. But he had no experience of lack of confidence
because he had confidence in her
have it. Now
feeling and that one ought to feel confidence
felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and
irrational
was standing face to face with life
loving someone other than himself
irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself. All his
life Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres
having to do with the reflection of life. And every time he had
stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it. Now he
experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who
a precipice by a bridge
broken
the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had
lived. For the first time the question presented itself to him of the
possibility of his wife’s loving someone else
it.

He did not undress
the resounding parquet of the dining-room
over the carpet of the dark drawing-room
reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa
across her boudoir
of her parents and woman friends
writing-table
the bedroom door
especially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room
said to himself
express my view of it and my decision.” And he turned back again. “But
express what—what decision?” he said to himself in the drawing-room
and he found no reply. “But after all
into the boudoir
while with him. But what of that? Surely women in society can talk to
whom they please. And then
her
which had always had such weight with him before
no meaning at all. And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but
as he entered the dark drawing-room some inner voice told him that it
was not so
something. And he said to himself again in the dining-room
must decide and put a stop to it
again at the turn in the drawing-room he asked himself
And again he asked himself
“Nothing
wife; but again in the drawing-room he was convinced that something had
happened. His thoughts
without coming upon anything new. He noticed this
and sat down in her boudoir.

There
the top and an unfinished letter
began to think of her
first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life
her desires
life of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel
it. It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into. To put himself
in thought and feeling in another person’s place was a spiritual
exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch. He looked on this
spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.

“And the worst of it all
moment when my great work is approaching completion” (he was thinking
of the project he was bringing forward at the time)
need of all my mental peace and all my energies
worry should fall foul of me. But what’s to be done? I’m not one of
those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force
of character to face them.

“I must think it over
he said aloud.

“The question of her feelings
her soul
and falls under the head of religion
consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of
regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.

“And so
feelings
have nothing to do. My duty is clearly defined. As the head of the
family
part the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I
perceive
plainly to her.” And everything that he would say tonight to his wife
took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s head. Thinking over what he
would say
and mental powers for domestic consumption
it
him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a
ministerial report.

“I must say and express fully the following points: first
of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly
exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly
reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly
reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.” And
interlacing his fingers
joints of the fingers cracked. This trick
his fingers
needful to him at this juncture.

There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door. Alexey
Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.

A woman’s step was heard mounting the stairs. Alexey Alexandrovitch
ready for his speech
see if the crack would not come again. One joint cracked.

Already
she was close
frightened of the explanation confronting him....


Chapter 9

Anna came in with hanging head
Her face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of
brightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the
midst of a dark night. On seeing her husband
smiled

“You’re not in bed? What a wonder!” she said
and without stopping
Alexey Alexandrovitch
doorway.

“Anna

“With me?” she said
the dressing-room
she asked
it would be better to get to sleep.”

Anna said what came to her lips
own capacity for lying. How simple and natural were her words
likely that she was simply sleepy! She felt herself clad in an
impenetrable armor of falsehood. She felt that some unseen force had
come to her aid and was supporting her.

“Anna

“Warn me?” she said. “Of what?”

She looked at him so simply
her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural
either in the sound or the sense of her words. But to him
knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual
noticed it
every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once;
to him
that she did not care to say a word about herself
He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul
lain open before him
from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that
said straight out to him: “Yes
will be in future.” Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might
have
the key may yet be found

“I want to warn you
thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked
about in society. Your too animated conversation this evening with
Count Vronsky” (he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate
emphasis) “attracted attention.”

He talked and looked at her laughing eyes
with their impenetrable look
uselessness and idleness of his words.

“You’re always like that
misapprehending him
phrase. “One time you don’t like my being dull
don’t like my being lively. I wasn’t dull. Does that offend you?”

Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered

“Oh

“Anna
effort over himself

“But what is it all about?” she said
wonder. “What do you want of me?”

Alexey Alexandrovitch paused
saw that instead of doing as he had intended—that is to say
his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world—he had
unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her
conscience
them.

“This is what I meant to say to you
“and I beg you to listen to it. I consider jealousy
humiliating and degrading feeling
influenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot
be disregarded with impunity. This evening it was not I observed it
but judging by the impression made on the company
that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be
desired.”

“I positively don’t understand

“Well

She spoke

“I don’t understand a word. And
she said

“Anna
I am mistaken
for you. I am your husband

For an instant her face fell
away; but the word _love_ threw her into revolt again. She thought:
“Love? Can he love? If he hadn’t heard there was such a thing as love
he would never have used the word. He doesn’t even know what love is.”

“Alexey Alexandrovitch
what it is you find....”

“Pardon
speaking of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our
son and yourself. It may very well be
you utterly unnecessary and out of place; it may be that they are
called forth by my mistaken impression. In that case
forgive me. But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest
foundation for them

Alexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike
what he had prepared.

“I have nothing to say. And besides

Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed

When she came into the bedroom
sternly compressed
her bed
her again. She both feared his speaking and wished for it. But he was
silent. She waited for a long while without moving
about him. She thought of that other; she pictured him
her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of
him. Suddenly she heard an even
Alexey Alexandrovitch seemed
and ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded
again

“It’s late

she could herself see in the darkness.


Chapter 10

From that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his
wife. Nothing special happened. Anna went out into society
always done
Vronsky everywhere. Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this
nothing. All his efforts to draw her into open discussion she
confronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate
sort of amused perplexity. Outwardly everything was the same
inner relations were completely changed. Alexey Alexandrovitch
of great power in the world of politics
Like an ox with head bent
felt was lifted over him. Every time he began to think about it
felt that he must try once more
persuasion there was still hope of saving her
herself
began talking to her
had taken possession of her
to her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had meant to talk.
Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at
anyone who should say what he was saying. And in that tone it was
impossible to say what needed to be said to her.


Chapter 11

That which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing
desire of his life
had been an impossible
entrancing dream of bliss
before her
not knowing how or why.

“Anna! Anna!” he said with a choking voice

But the louder he spoke
now shame-stricken head
where she was sitting
fallen on the carpet if he had not held her.

“My God! Forgive me!” she said
bosom.

She felt so sinful
humiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in
her life but him
Looking at him
could say nothing more. He felt what a murderer must feel
the body he has robbed of life. That body
their love
and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful
price of shame. Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and
infected him. But in spite of all the murderer’s horror before the body
of his victim
he has gained by his murder.

And with fury
and drags it and hacks at it; so he covered her face and shoulders with
kisses. She held his hand
what has been bought by this shame. Yes
always be mine—the hand of my accomplice.” She lifted up that hand and
kissed it. He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid
it
she got up and pushed him away. Her face was still as beautiful
was only the more pitiful for that.

“All is over

“I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of this
happiness....”

“Happiness!” she said with horror and loathing and her horror
unconsciously infected him. “For pity’s sake
more.”

She rose quickly and moved away from him.

“Not a word more
incomprehensible to him
moment she could not put into words the sense of shame
of horror at this stepping into a new life
speak of it
later too
in which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed
could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all
that was in her soul.

She said to herself: “No
I am calmer.” But this calm for thought never came; every time the
thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her
what she ought to do
thoughts away.

“Later

But in dreams
presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness. One dream haunted
her almost every night. She dreamed that both were her husbands at
once
was weeping
Alexey Vronsky was there too
marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her
them
of them were happy and contented. But this dream weighed on her like a
nightmare


Chapter 12

In the early days after his return from Moscow
shuddered and grew red
said to himself: “This was just how I used to shudder and blush
thinking myself utterly lost
get my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had
mismanaged that affair of my sister’s that was entrusted to me. And
yet
distress me so much. It will be the same thing too with this trouble.
Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either.”

But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it;
and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first
days. He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family
life
was further than ever from marriage. He was painfully conscious
himself
man to be alone. He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had
once said to his cowman Nikolay
liked talking to: “Well
Nikolay had promptly answered
no possible doubt: “And high time too
marriage had now become further off than ever. The place was taken
whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place
felt that it was utterly impossible. Moreover
rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with
shame. However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in
it
similar kind
in every man’s
conscience ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil
actions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but
humiliating reminiscences. These wounds never healed. And with these
memories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which
he must have appeared to others that evening. But time and work did
their part. Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the
incidents—paltry in his eyes
Every week he thought less often of Kitty. He was impatiently looking
forward to the news that she was married
hoping that such news would
him.

Meanwhile spring came on
treacheries of spring
beasts
more
and building up his lonely life firmly and independently. Though many
of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been
carried out
been kept by him. He was free from that shame
harassed him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the
face. In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna
telling him that his brother Nikolay’s health was getting worse
that he would not take advice
went to Moscow to his brother’s and succeeded in persuading him to see
a doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad. He succeeded so well in
persuading his brother
without irritating him
matter. In addition to his farming
in spring
work on agriculture
the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data
of the question
deducing all the principles of scientific culture
data of soil and climate
certain unalterable character of the laborer. Thus
solitude
full. Only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate
his stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna. With her indeed he
not infrequently fell into discussion upon physics
agriculture
Mihalovna’s favorite subject.

Spring was slow in unfolding. For the last few weeks it had been
steadily fine frosty weather. In the daytime it thawed in the sun
at night there were even seven degrees of frost. There was such a
frozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the
roads. Easter came in the snow. Then all of a sudden
a warm wind sprang up
and three nights the warm
the wind dropped
hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in
nature. Behind the fog there was the flowing of water
floating of ice
following Monday
split up into little curling crests of cloud
real spring had come. In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly
wore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water
warm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened
earth. The old grass looked greener
tiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the
sticky birch-buds were swollen with sap
humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow. Larks
trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered
stubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by
the pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering
their spring calls. The cattle
not grown yet
their bleating mothers. Nimble children ran about the drying paths
covered with the prints of bare feet. There was a merry chatter of
peasant women over their linen at the pond
yard
spring had come.


Chapter 13

Levin put on his big boots
instead of his fur cloak
over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his
eyes

Spring is the time of plans and projects. And
farmyard
taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds
hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the
farm work that was so dear to him. But he felt that he was full of the
most splendid plans and projects. First of all he went to the cattle.
The cows had been let out into their paddock
were already shining with their new
in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow. Levin gazed admiringly
at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their
condition
and the calves to be let into the paddock. The herdsman ran gaily to
get ready for the meadow. The cowherd girls
petticoats
not yet brown from the sun
the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.

After admiring the young ones of that year
fine—the early calves were the size of a peasant’s cow
daughter
orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the
paddock. But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during
the winter
for the carpenter
work at the thrashing machine. But it appeared that the carpenter was
repairing the harrows
This was very annoying to Levin. It was annoying to come upon that
everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been
striving with all his might for so many years. The hurdles
ascertained
cart-horses’ stable; and there broken
construction
also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements
directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter
purpose he had hired three carpenters
and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been
harrowing the field. Levin sent for his bailiff
off himself to look for him. The bailiff
everyone that day
the barn

“Why isn’t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?”

“Oh
it’s time they got to work in the fields.”

“But what were they doing in the winter

“But what did you want the carpenter for?”

“Where are the hurdles for the calves’ paddock?”

“I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those
peasants!” said the bailiff

“It’s not those peasants but this bailiff!” said Levin
“Why
this would not help matters
sentence
he asked

“Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.”

“And the clover?”

“I’ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they’re sowing. Only I don’t know if
they’ll manage to get through; it’s so slushy.”

“How many acres?”

“About fifteen.”

“Why not sow all?” cried Levin.

That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres
forty-five
from books and from his own experience
was sown as early as possible
never get this done.

“There’s no one to send. What would you have with such a set of
peasants? Three haven’t turned up. And there’s Semyon....”

“Well

“And so I have

“Where are the peasants

“Five are making compôte” (which meant compost)
oats for fear of a touch of mildew

Levin knew very well that “a touch of mildew” meant that his English
seed oats were already ruined. Again they had not done as he had
ordered.

“Why

“Don’t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.”

Levin waved his hand angrily
oats
peasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let
them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be
done
over his vexation with the bailiff. Indeed
that one could not be angry.

“Ignat!” he called to the coachman
was washing the carriage wheels

“Which

“Well

“Yes

While they were saddling his horse
who was hanging about in sight
talking to him about the spring operations before them
for the farm.

The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier
before the early mowing. And the ploughing of the further land to go on
without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow. And the mowing to
be all done by hired labor
attentively
projects. But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always
irritated him
“That’s all very well

Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the tone
common to all the bailiffs he had ever had. They had all taken up that
attitude to his plans
mortified
seemed
could find no other expression than “as God wills.”

“If we can manage it

“Why ever shouldn’t you manage it?”

“We positively must have another fifteen laborers. And they don’t turn
up. There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.”

Levin was silent. Again he was brought face to face with that opposing
force. He knew that however much they tried
than forty—thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight—laborers for a
reasonable sum. Some forty had been taken on
But still he could not help struggling against it.

“Send to Sury
them.”

“Oh
“But there are the horses

“We’ll get some more. I know
always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but
this year I’m not going to let you have things your own way. I’ll see
to everything myself.”

“Why
work under the master’s eye....”

“So they’re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I’ll go and have a
look at them
was led up by the coachman.

“You can’t get across the streams
coachman shouted.

“All right

And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out
into the open country
inactivity
asking
cattle pens and farmyard
Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob
drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air
rode through his forest over the crumbling
parts
with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots.
When he came out of the forest
grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green
place or swamp
of melting snow. He was not put out of temper even by the sight of the
peasants’ horses and colts trampling down his young grass (he told a
peasant he met to drive them out)
reply of the peasant Ipat
Ipat
Konstantin Dmitrievitch
happier he became
than the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern
borders
into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a
cattle yard at the further end of the estate
construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.
And then eight hundred acres of wheat
four hundred of clover

Absorbed in such dreams
as not to trample his young crops
been sent to sow clover. A cart with the seed in it was standing
at the edge
been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse. Both the laborers
were sitting in the hedge
in the cart
but crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing the master
laborer
sowing. This was not as it should be
seldom lost his temper. When Vassily came up
the horse to the hedge.

“It’s all right

“Please don’t argue

“Yes
sowing
Only it’s a work to get about! You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.”

“Why is it you have earth that’s not sifted?” said Levin.

“Well
rolling the earth in his palms.

Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with
unsifted earth

Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his
anger
way now. He watched how Mishka strode along
earth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse
sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.

“Where did you stop?”

Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot
best he could
difficult as on a bog
in a great heat

“Well
rows

“Eh?” said Levin cheerily

“Why
where I sowed last spring. How I did work at it! I do my best
Konstantin Dmitrievitch
don’t like bad work myself
good for the master’s good for us too. To look out yonder now
Vassily

“It’s a lovely spring

“Why
was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too
it. He was saying you wouldn’t know it from rye.”

“Have you been sowing wheat long?”

“Why
measures. We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.”

“Well
horse
have half a rouble for every acre.”

“Humbly thankful. We are very well content

Levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year’s
clover

The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. It had
survived everything
stalks of last year’s wheat. The horse sank in up to the pasterns
he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground.
Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only
keep a foothold where there was ice
deep in at each step. The ploughland was in splendid condition; in a
couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing. Everything was
capital
hoping the water would have gone down. And he did in fact get across
and startled two ducks. “There must be snipe too
as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper
confirmed his theory about the snipe.

Levin went home at a trot
his gun ready for the evening.


Chapter 14

As he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind
the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.

“Yes
time to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be? What if it’s
brother Nikolay? He did say: ‘Maybe I’ll go to the waters
I’ll come down to you.’” He felt dismayed and vexed for the first
minute
happy mood of spring. But he felt ashamed of the feeling
he opened
feeling of joy and expectation
was his brother. He pricked up his horse
the acacias he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station
and a gentleman in a fur coat. It was not his brother. “Oh
only some nice person one could talk to a little!” he thought.

“Ah
delightful visitor! Ah
recognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“I shall find out for certain whether she’s married
going to be married
felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all.

“Well
of the sledge
cheek
“I’ve come to see you in the first place
kissing him
forest at Ergushovo third.”

“Delightful! What a spring we’re having! How ever did you get along in
a sledge?”

“In a cart it would have been worse still
answered the driver

“Well
smile of childlike delight.

Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors
Arkadyevitch’s things were carried also—a bag
satchel for cigars. Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes
Levin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and
clover. Agafea Mihalovna

“Do just as you like
went to the bailiff.

When he came back
his room with a beaming smile

“Well
what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here.
No
cheerful!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
spring and fine weather like that day. “And your nurse is simply
charming! A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable
perhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news;
especially interesting to Levin was the news that his brother
Ivanovitch

Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the
Shtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife. Levin was
grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor. As
always happened with him during his solitude
feelings had been accumulating within him
communicate to those about him. And now he poured out upon Stepan
Arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring
for the land
reading
though he was unaware of it himself
on agriculture. Stepan Arkadyevitch
everything at the slightest reference
this visit
and a new tone of respect that flattered him.

The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook
particularly good
preliminary course
and salted mushrooms
served without the accompaniment of little pies
had particularly meant to impress their visitor. But though Stepan
Arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners
everything excellent: the herb brandy
and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms
and the chicken in white sauce
was superb and delicious.

“Splendid
feel as if
noise and jolting of a steamer. And so you maintain that the laborer
himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of
methods in agriculture. Of course
should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the
laborer too.”

“Yes
of the science of agriculture. It ought to be like the natural
sciences
economic

At that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.

“Oh
his plump fingers
think

Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare
tree-tops of the forest.

“Yes
downstairs.

Stepan Arkadyevitch
his varnished gun case with his own hands
ready his expensive new-fashioned gun. Kouzma

stockings and boots

“Kostya
to come today

“Why

“Yes. Do you know him?”

“To be sure I do. I have had to do business with him
conclusively.’”

Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed. “Positively and conclusively” were the
merchant’s favorite words.

“Yes
master’s going!” he added
and licking his hands

The trap was already at the steps when they went out.

“I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?”

“No
trap. He sat down
cigar. “How is it you don’t smoke? A cigar is a sort of thing
exactly a pleasure
this is life! How splendid it is! This is how I should like to live!”

“Why

“No
horses—and you have them; dogs—you have them; shooting—you have it;
farming—you have it.”

“Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have
haven’t

Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended

Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing
tact
saying nothing about them. But now Levin was longing to find out what
was tormenting him so

“Come
himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.

Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled merrily.

“You don’t admit
has had one’s rations of bread—to your mind it’s a crime; but I don’t
count life as life without love
own way. “What am I to do? I’m made that way. And really
little harm to anyone

“What! is there something new

“Yes
Ossian’s women.... Women
women are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are
terrible. Woman
you study it

“Well

“No. Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for
truth

Levin listened in silence
could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and
understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women.


Chapter 15

The place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in
a little aspen copse. On reaching the copse
and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy
free from snow. He went back himself to a double birch tree on the
other side
took off his full overcoat
arms to see if they were free.

Gray old Laska
pricked up her ears. The sun was setting behind a thick forest
the glow of sunset the birch trees
stood out clearly with their hanging twigs
almost to bursting.

From the thickest parts of the copse
came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away.
Tiny birds twittered

In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last
year’s leaves
the grass.

“Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!” Levin said to
himself
of young grass. He stood
mossy ground
sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him
at the darkening sky

A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings;
another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and
vanished. The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the
thicket. An owl hooted not far off
cautiously a few steps forward
to listen intently. Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo. Twice she
uttered her usual cuckoo call
broke down.

“Imagine! the cuckoo already!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
from behind a bush.

“Yes
with his voice
coming!”

Stepan Arkadyevitch’s figure again went behind the bush
nothing but the bright flash of a match
blue smoke of a cigarette.

“Tchk! tchk!” came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking
his gun.

“What’s that cry?” asked Oblonsky
prolonged cry
play.

“Oh
it’s flying!” almost shrieked Levin

They heard a shrill whistle in the distance
well known to the sportsman
after the third whistle the hoarse

Levin looked about him to right and to left
against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of
the aspens
the guttural cry
close to his ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen
at the very instant when Levin was taking aim
Oblonsky stood
like an arrow
the sound of a blow
up in the air
a heavy splash on the slushy ground.

“Can I have missed it?” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch
for the smoke.

“Here it is!” said Levin
wagging the end of her shaggy tail
would prolong the pleasure
bird to her master. “Well
who
shooting the snipe.

“It was a bad shot from the right barrel
Arkadyevitch

The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again. Two
snipe
flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen. There was the report
of four shots
the air and vanished from sight.



The stand-shooting was capital. Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds
and Levin two
bright and silvery
behind the birch trees
of Arcturus. Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear
and lost them again. The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to
stay a little longer
should be above it
plain. Venus had risen above the branch
with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky
yet still he waited.

“Isn’t it time to go home?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.

It was quite still now in the copse

“Let’s stay a little while

“As you like.”

They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.

“Stiva!” said Levin unexpectedly; “how is it you don’t tell me whether
your sister-in-law’s married yet

Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer
affect him. But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch
replied.

“She’s never thought of being married
she’s very ill
positively afraid she may not live.”

“What!” cried Levin. “Very ill? What is wrong with her? How has
she...?”

While they were saying this
upwards at the sky

“They have chosen a time to talk
wing.... Here it is

But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which
it were
two flashes gleamed
The snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a
thicket

“Splendid! Together!” cried Levin
thicket to look for the snipe.

“Oh
ill.... Well

“She’s found it! Isn’t she a clever thing?” he said
bird from Laska’s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.
“I’ve got it


Chapter 16

On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty’s illness and the
Shtcherbatskys’ plans
it
still hope
made him suffer so much. But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of
the causes of Kitty’s illness
him short.

“I have no right whatever to know family matters
truth

Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly
instantaneous change he knew so well in Levin’s face
as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.

“Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?” asked Levin.

“Yes
Eight straight away
about it for ever so long. No one would give more.”

“Then you’ve as good as given away your forest for nothing
gloomily.

“How do you mean for nothing?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a
good-humored smile
now.

“Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the
acre

“Oh
contempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes to business
it better than anyone. I assure you I have reckoned it all out
said
afraid of this fellow’s crying off
‘timber
convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts. “And it
won’t run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre
giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.”

Levin smiled contemptuously. “I know
only in him
years in the country
season and out of season
‘_Timber

“I wouldn’t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office

you’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest. It’s difficult.
Have you counted the trees?”

“How count the trees?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
to draw his friend out of his ill-temper. “Count the sands of the sea
number the stars. Some higher power might do it.”

“Oh

At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather
with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps. In the
trap sat the chubby
coachman. Ryabinin himself was already in the house
friends in the hall. Ryabinin was a tall
with mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin

“Quite so

as to how to behave

On entering the study Ryabinin looked about
though seeking the holy picture

same dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe
contemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly
willing to allow that this game were worth the candle.

open courts and everything done in style
of stealing. We are just talking things over like gentlemen. His
excellency’s asking too much for the forest. I can’t make both ends
meet over it. I must ask for a little concession.”

“But is the thing settled between you or not? If it’s settled

Levin went out of the room

Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes

Levin certainly was out of humor

gradually begun to work upon him.

“Because I don’t shake hands with a waiter

“Yes

Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly

“Come

Stepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea

“Well
Konstantin Dmitrievitch
eat it and walk away.”

Though Levin tried to control himself
wanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch
bring himself to the point
in which to put it. Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room
undressed

talking of various trifling matters
wanted to know.

“How wonderfully they make this soap

Levin scowled. The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart
as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received. But he was
at home

“Stay
an aristocrat. But allow me to ask what it consists in
aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else

“No; I don’t know whether you know it or not

“What ever for? What nonsense!”

“Capital.”


Chapter 18

Although all Vronsky’s inner life was absorbed in his passion
external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old
accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests. The
interests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky’s life
both because he was fond of the regiment
fond of him. They were not only fond of Vronsky in his regiment
respected him too
immense wealth
open before him to every kind of success
had disregarded all that
interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart.
Vronsky was aware of his comrades’ view of him
liking for the life

It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his
comrades
bouts (though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of
himself). And he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted
to allude to his connection. But in spite of that
to all the town; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his
relations with Madame Karenina. The majority of the younger men envied
him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love—the exalted
position of Karenin
in society.

The greater number of the young women
been weary of hearing her called _virtuous_
fulfillment of their predictions
turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their
scorn. They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at
her when the right moment arrived. The greater number of the
middle-aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the
prospect of the impending scandal in society.

Vronsky’s mother
it
brilliant young man as a _liaison_ in the highest society; she was
pleased
talked so much of her son
and well-bred women
ideas. But she had heard of late that her son had refused a position
offered him of great importance to his career

Karenina. She learned that great personages were displeased with him on
this account

departure from Moscow

This elder son

displeasure by those whom it was necessary to please
did not approve of his brother’s conduct.

Besides the service and society
interest—horses; he was passionately fond of horses.

That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers.
Vronsky had put his name down
in spite of his love affair
intense

These two passions did not interfere with one another. On the contrary
he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love
to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated
him.

From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking
talk and laughter. Two officers appeared at the entrance-door: one
young fellow
regiment from the Corps of Pages; the other
with a bracelet on his wrist

Vronsky glanced at them
though he had not noticed them
same time.

“What? Fortifying yourself for your work?” said the plump officer
sitting down beside him.

“As you see
and not looking at the officer.

“So you’re not afraid of getting fat?” said the latter
round for the young officer.

“What?” said Vronsky angrily
his even teeth.

“You’re not afraid of getting fat?”

“Waiter

The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young
officer.

“You choose what we’re to drink

“Rhine wine

that Vronsky did not turn round

“Let’s go into the billiard room

The plump officer rose submissively

At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built
Captain Yashvin. Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two
officers

“Ah! here he is!” he cried
epaulet. Vronsky looked round angrily
immediately with his characteristic expression of genial and manly
serenity.

“That’s it
just eat a mouthful

“Oh

“There go the inseparables

“Why didn’t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday? Numerova wasn’t

Yashvin
principles
friend in the regiment. Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional
physical strength
drink like a fish
degree affected by it; and for his great strength of character
he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers
commanding both fear and respect
for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk
such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the
English Club. Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because
he felt Yashvin liked him
himself. And of all men he was the only one with whom Vronsky would
have liked to speak of his love. He felt that Yashvin
apparent contempt for every sort of feeling
could
his whole life. Moreover
no delight in gossip and scandal
that is to say
a pastime

Vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion
he knew all about it
and he was glad to see that in his eyes.

“Ah! yes
Tverskoys’; and his black eyes shining
mustache

“Well

“Eight thousand. But three don’t count; he won’t pay up.”

“Oh
(Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.)

“No chance of my losing. Mahotin’s the only one that’s risky.”

And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race
thing Vronsky could think of just now.

“Come along
the door. Yashvin got up too
back.

“It’s too early for me to dine
along directly. Hi

“No

And he walked out with Vronsky.


Chapter 20

Vronsky was staying in a roomy
a partition. Petritsky lived with him in camp too. Petritsky was asleep
when Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut.

“Get up
partition and giving Petritsky
with his nose in the pillow

Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round.

“Your brother’s been here

“Go along

“Where are you off to?” asked Yashvin. “Oh
horses

“To the stables
said Vronsky.

Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky’s
from Peterhof
he hoped to have time to get that in too. But his comrades were at once
aware that he was not only going there.

Petritsky
though he would say: “Oh

“Mind you’re not late!” was Yashvin’s only comment; and to change the
conversation: “How’s my roan? is he doing all right?” he inquired
looking out of the window at the middle one of the three horses
he had sold Vronsky.

“Stop!” cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he was just going out. “Your
brother left a letter and a note for you. Wait a bit; where are they?”

Vronsky stopped.

“Well

“Where are they? That’s just the question!” said Petritsky solemnly
moving his forefinger upwards from his nose.

“Come

“I have not lighted the fire. Here somewhere about.”

“Come

“No
But what’s the use of getting in a rage. If you’d drunk four bottles
yesterday as I did you’d forget where you were lying. Wait a bit
remember!”

Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed.

“Wait a bit! This was how I was lying
standing. Yes—yes—yes.... Here it is!”—and Petritsky pulled a letter
out from under the mattress

Vronsky took the letter and his brother’s note. It was the letter he
was expecting—from his mother
see her—and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a
little talk with him. Vronsky knew that it was all about the same
thing. “What business is it of theirs!” thought Vronsky
up the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to
read them carefully on the road. In the porch of the hut he was met by
two officers; one of his regiment and one of another.

Vronsky’s quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers.

“Where are you off to?”

“I must go to Peterhof.”

“Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?”

“Yes

“They say Mahotin’s Gladiator’s lame.”

“Nonsense! But however are you going to race in this mud?” said the
other.

“Here are my saviors!” cried Petritsky
stood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers. “Here’s

“Vronsky!” shouted someone when he was already outside.

“Well?”

“You’d better get your hair cut

as not to distract his attention before looking at the mare. “Later!”

The temporary stable

During the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise
himself
positively did not know in what condition his mare had arrived
yesterday and was today. He had scarcely got out of his carriage when
his groom

and a short jacket
came to meet him

“Well

They went into the little yard in front of the shed. A stable boy

He opened the door

“Well

“All right

Vronsky in amazement raised his head

at the impertinence of his question. But realizing that in asking this
the Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer
jockey

“I’ve got to go to Bryansky’s; I shall be home within an hour.”

“How often I’m asked that question today!” he said to himself

gravely at him; and
he added:

“The great thing’s to keep quiet before a race

“All right

with a look of submissive tenderness

Chapter 24

When Vronsky looked at his watch on the Karenins’ balcony
greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on
the watch’s face
on to the highroad and walked
mud
Anna
had time to go to Bryansky’s. He had left him
the external faculty of memory
take
on the box in the shadow
admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses
and
drive to Bryansky’s. It was only after driving nearly five miles that
he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch
that it was half-past five

There were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards’ race
then the officers’ mile-and-a-half race
then the race for which he was entered. He could still be in time for
his race
and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their
places. That would be a pity. But he had promised Bryansky to come
so he decided to drive on
horses.

He reached Bryansky’s
This rapid drive calmed him. All that was painful in his relations with
Anna
slipped out of his mind. He was thinking now with pleasure and
excitement of the race
the thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed
across his imagination like a flaming light.

The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove
further and further into the atmosphere of the races

At his quarters no one was left at home; all were at the races

people on foot
swarming with people. The second race was apparently going on
as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing. Going towards the
stable
led to the race-course in a blue forage horsecloth
like huge ears edged with blue.

“Where’s Cord?” he asked the stable-boy.

“In the stable

In the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou
going to lead her out.

“I’m not too late?”

“All right! All right!” said the Englishman; “don’t upset yourself!”

Vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his
favorite mare; who was quivering all over
himself from the sight of her
towards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping
attention. The mile-and-a-half race was just finishing
were fixed on the horse-guard in front and the light hussar behind
urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post.
From the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the
winning post
were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their
officer and comrade. Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd
unnoticed
of the race
bending over the saddle
that looked dark with sweat.

The horse

waking up from a heavy sleep
friends and outsiders pressed round him.

Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world
which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the
pavilions. He knew that Madame Karenina was there
brother’s wife
something distracting his attention. But he was continually met and
stopped by acquaintances
kept asking him why he was so late.

At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the
prizes

to his mare.

Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle
give some direction
to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting. Seventeen
officers
together in the pavilion and drew the numbers. Vronsky drew the number
seven. The cry was heard: “Mount!”

composed in his movements. Cord

was still trembling as though in a fever. Her eye
glanced sideways at Vronsky. Vronsky slipped his finger under the
saddle-girth. The mare glanced aslant at him
twitched her ear. The Englishman puckered up his lips
indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling.

“Get up; you won’t feel so excited.”

Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals. He knew that he
would not see them during the race. Two were already riding forward to
the point from which they were to start. Galtsin
and one of his more formidable rivals
that would not let him mount. A little light hussar in tight riding
breeches rode off at a gallop
imitation of English jockeys. Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on
his thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud
led her by the bridle. Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev and
his peculiarity of “weak nerves” and terrible vanity. They knew that he
was afraid of everything
just because it was terrible
there was a doctor standing at each obstacle
cross on it
part in the race. Their eyes met

“Don’t be in a hurry

They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the
starting point. Several of the riders were in front and several behind
when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud
behind him
lop-eared Gladiator. Mahotin smiled
Vronsky looked angrily at him. He did not like him
now as his most formidable rival. He was angry with him for galloping
past and exciting his mare. Frou-Frou started into a gallop

passed into a jolting trot

Chapter 25

There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race. The race
course was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front
of the pavilion. On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the
stream
pavilion
Irish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles
mound fenced with brushwood
the horses
killed); then two more ditches filled with water
the end of the race was just facing the pavilion. But the race began

Three times they were ranged ready to start

was starting them
when at last for the fourth time he shouted “Away!” and the racers
started.

Every eye
of riders at the moment they were in line to start.

“They’re off! They’re starting!” was heard on all sides after the hush
of expectation.

And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running
from place to place to get a better view. In the very first minute the
close group of horsemen drew out
approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another. To
the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously
but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value
to them.

Frou-Frou
several horses had started before her
Vronsky
at the bridle
him Mahotin’s chestnut Gladiator
lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky
in front of all
alive.

For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his
mare. Up to the first obstacle
motions of his mare.

Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same
instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to
the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them
very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air
almost under his mare’s hoofs Kuzovlev
on the further side of the stream. (Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he
took the leap
details Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just
under him
in the way. But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of
leaping
beyond her.

“O the darling!” thought Vronsky.

After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare
began holding her in
Mahotin
hundred yards that followed it.

The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion. The
Tsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at
them—at him
“devil
eyes fastened upon him from all sides
ears and neck of his own mare
back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him
keeping always the same distance ahead. Gladiator rose
of knocking against anything. With a wave of his short tail he
disappeared from Vronsky’s sight.

“Bravo!” cried a voice.

At the same instant
palings of the barrier. Without the slightest change in her action his
mare flew over it; the palings vanished
behind him. The mare
too soon before the barrier
pace never changed
realized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator. Once
more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail
again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.

At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to
overtake Mahotin
without any incitement on his part
began getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side
the inner cord. Mahotin would not let her pass that side. Vronsky had
hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side
when Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other
side. Frou-Frou’s shoulder
even with Gladiator’s back. For a few lengths they moved evenly. But
before the obstacle they were approaching
reins
passed Mahotin just upon the declivity. He caught a glimpse of his
mud-stained face as he flashed by. He even fancied that he smiled.
Vronsky passed Mahotin
him
and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.

The next two obstacles
crossed
closer upon him. He urged on his mare
easily quickened her pace
heard at the same distance away.

Vronsky was at the head of the race
Cord had advised
excitement
and keener. He longed to look round again
and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same
reserve of force in her as he felt that Gladiator still kept. There
remained only one obstacle
ahead of the others he would come in first. He was flying towards the
Irish barricade
the distance
He saw the uncertainty in the mare’s ears and lifted the whip
the same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what
was wanted. She quickened her pace and rose smoothly
fancied she would

back into her pace again.

“Bravo

not fail to recognize Yashvin’s voice though he did not see him.

“O my sweet!” he said inwardly to Frou-Frou
was happening behind. “He’s cleared it!” he thought
of Gladiator’s hoofs behind him. There remained only the last ditch
filled with water and five feet wide. Vronsky did not even look at it
but anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins
lifting the mare’s head and letting it go in time with her paces. He
felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength; not her
neck and shoulders merely were wet
on her mane
sharp gasps. But he knew that she had strength left more than enough
for the remaining five hundred yards. It was only from feeling himself
nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that
Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace. She flew over
the ditch as though not noticing it. She flew over it like a bird; but
at the same instant Vronsky
keep up with the mare’s pace
fearful
All at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful
had happened. He could not yet make out what had happened

foot
his leg when she fell on one side
efforts to rise with her delicate
ground at his feet like a shot bird. The clumsy movement made by
Vronsky had broken her back. But that he only knew much later. At that
moment he knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by
staggering alone on the muddy
gasping before him
exquisite eyes. Still unable to realize what had happened
tugged at his mare’s reins. Again she struggled all over like a fish
and her shoulders setting the saddle heaving
legs but unable to lift her back
on her side. With a face hideous with passion
and his cheeks white
and again fell to tugging at the rein. She did not stir
her nose into the ground
speaking eyes.

“A—a—a!” groaned Vronsky

Chapter 26

The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had
remained unchanged. The sole difference lay in the fact that he was
more busily occupied than ever. As in former years
the spring he had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his
health
just as always he returned in July and at once fell to work as usual
with increased energy. As usual
to a villa out of town
of their conversation after the party at Princess Tverskaya’s he had
never spoken again to Anna of his suspicions and his jealousies
that habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was the most convenient
tone possible for his present attitude to his wife. He was a little
colder to his wife. He simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her
for that first midnight conversation
attitude to her there was a shade of vexation
would not be open with me
“so much the worse for you. Now you may beg as you please
be open with you. So much the worse for you!” he said mentally

rage with his vain efforts and say
for this!” This man
realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife. He did
not realize it
actual position
that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family
is
the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son
to him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife. “Aha
man!” was the greeting with which he met him.

Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any
previous year had so much official business as that year. But he was
not aware that he sought work for himself that year
of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his
feelings towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them
became more terrible the longer they lay there. If anyone had had the
right to ask Alexey Alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife’s
behavior
no answer
should question him on that subject. For this reason there positively
came into Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face a look of haughtiness and
severity whenever anyone inquired after his wife’s health. Alexey
Alexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his wife’s behavior
and he actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all.

Alexey Alexandrovitch’s permanent summer villa was in Peterhof
Countess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there
to Anna
declined to settle in Peterhof
in conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability
of Anna’s close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky. Alexey Alexandrovitch
sternly cut her short
suspicion
He did not want to see
cast dubious glances on his wife; he did not want to understand
did not understand
staying at Tsarskoe
of Vronsky’s regiment. He did not allow himself to think about it
he did not think about it; but all the same though he never admitted it
to himself
bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived
husband

How often during those eight years of happy life with his wife Alexey
Alexandrovitch had looked at other men’s faithless wives and other
deceived husbands and asked himself: “How can people descend to that?
how is it they don’t put an end to such a hideous position?” But now
when the misfortune had come upon himself
of putting an end to the position that he would not recognize it at
all
unnatural.

Since his return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at
their country villa. Once he dined there
evening there with a party of friends
night there

The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey
Alexandrovitch; but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning
he made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife
immediately after dinner
Court were to witness
going to see his wife
to keep up appearances. And besides
fifteenth
according to their usual arrangement.

With his habitual control over his thoughts
about his wife
her.

That morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch. The evening
before
traveler in China
enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself
extremely interesting person from various points of view
be useful. Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet
through in the evening
began arriving with petitions
appointments
notes
always took up so much time. Then there was private business of his
own
The steward did not take up much time. He simply gave Alexey
Alexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of
the position of his affairs
it had happened that during that year
more had been paid out than usual
doctor
acquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch
Alexey Alexandrovitch had not expected him that day
at his visit
carefully about his health
his liver. Alexey Alexandrovitch did not know that his friend Lidia
Ivanovna
begged the doctor to go and examine him. “Do this for my sake
Countess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him.

“I will do it for the sake of Russia

“A priceless man!” said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.

The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch. He
found the liver considerably enlarged
weakened
effect. He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible
far as possible less mental strain
words
abstaining from breathing. Then he withdrew
Alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him
and that there was no chance of curing it.

As he was coming away
acquaintance of his
Alexandrovitch’s department. They had been comrades at the university
and though they rarely met
excellent friends
have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin.

“How glad I am you’ve been seeing him!” said Sludin. “He’s not well
and I fancy.... Well

“I’ll tell you
coachman to bring the carriage round. “It’s just this
doctor
it
you’ll find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost
and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it.
And with his close assiduity
he’s strained to the utmost; and there’s some outside burden weighing
on him
eyebrows significantly. “Will you be at the races?” he added
sank into his seat in the carriage.

“Yes
responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin’s he had not caught.

Directly after the doctor
celebrated traveler
pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous
acquaintance with the subject
his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his
view of it.

At the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial
marshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg
Alexandrovitch had to have some conversation. After his departure
had to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary
then he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage
on a matter of grave and serious import. Alexey Alexandrovitch only
just managed to be back by five o’clock
dining with his secretary
country villa and to the races.

Though he did not acknowledge it to himself
always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his
interviews with his wife.


Chapter 27

Anna was upstairs
Annushka’s assistance
heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance.

“It’s too early for Betsy
she caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey
Alexandrovitch
side of it. “How unlucky! Can he be going to stay the night?” she
wondered
struck her as so awful and terrible that
moment
conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in
herself that she had come to know of late
that spirit and began talking

“Ah
greeting Sludin
staying the night
prompted her to utter; “and now we’ll go together. Only it’s a pity
I’ve promised Betsy. She’s coming for me.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch knit his brows at Betsy’s name.

“Oh
bantering tone. “I’m going with Mihail Vassilievitch. I’m ordered
exercise by the doctors too. I’ll walk
again.”

“There’s no hurry

She rang.

“Bring in tea
Well
to see me before. Look how lovely it is out on the terrace
turning first to one and then to the other.

She spoke very simply and naturally
the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail
Vassilievitch turned on her that he was
her.

Mihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace.

She sat down beside her husband.

“You don’t look quite well

“Yes
my time. I feel that someone of our friends must have sent him: my
health’s so precious

“No; what did he say?”

She questioned him about his health and what he had been doing
tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her.

All this she said brightly
her eyes. But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special
significance to this tone of hers. He heard only her words and gave
them only the direct sense they bore. And he answered simply
jestingly. There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation
never after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing
pang of shame.

Seryozha came in preceded by his governess. If Alexey Alexandrovitch
had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and
bewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and
then at his mother. But he would not see anything
it.

“Ah
are you

And he gave his hand to the scared child. Seryozha had been shy of his
father before
calling him young man
to him whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe
He looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter. It was
only with his mother that he was at ease. Meanwhile
Alexandrovitch was holding his son by the shoulder while he was
speaking to the governess
that Anna saw he was on the point of tears.

Anna
that Seryozha was uncomfortable
Alexandrovitch’s hand from her son’s shoulder
him out onto the terrace

“It’s time to start
it Betsy doesn’t come?...”

“Yes
and cracked his fingers. “I’ve come to bring you some money
nightingales

“No
crimsoning to the roots of her hair. “But you’ll come back here after
the races

“Oh
Peterhof
the elegant English carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high.
“What elegance! Charming! Well

Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage
high boots

“I’m going; good-bye!” said Anna
Alexey Alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him. “It was ever so
nice of you to come.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand.

“Well
delightful!” she said
she no longer saw him
lips had touched


Chapter 28

When Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race-course
sitting in the pavilion beside Betsy
highest society had gathered. She caught sight of her husband in the
distance. Two men
her existence
their nearness. She was aware of her husband approaching a long way
off
midst of which he was moving. She watched his progress towards the
pavilion
bow
assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world
and taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears.
All these ways of his she knew
but ambition
his soul
religion

From his glances towards the ladies’ pavilion (he was staring straight
at her
feathers
but she purposely avoided noticing him.

“Alexey Alexandrovitch!” Princess Betsy called to him; “I’m sure you
don’t see your wife: here she is.”

He smiled his chilly smile.

“There’s so much splendor here that one’s eyes are dazzled
and he went into the pavilion. He smiled to his wife as a man should
smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her
the princess and other acquaintances
is to say
among the men. Below
adjutant-general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a high opinion
noted for his intelligence and culture. Alexey Alexandrovitch entered
into conversation with him.

There was an interval between the races
conversation. The adjutant-general expressed his disapproval of races.
Alexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them. Anna heard his high
measured tones
false

When the three-mile steeplechase was beginning
gazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse and
mounted
voice of her husband. She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky
still greater agony was the never-ceasing
of her husband’s shrill voice with its familiar intonations.

“I’m a wicked woman
lying
the breath of his life—falsehood. He knows all about it
all; what does he care if he can talk so calmly? If he were to kill me
if he were to kill Vronsky
falsehood and propriety
what it was she wanted of her husband
see him behave. She did not understand either that Alexey
Alexandrovitch’s peculiar loquacity that day
was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness. As a
child that has been hurt skips about
movement to drown the pain
needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her
presence and in Vronsky’s
name
for him to talk well and cleverly
about. He was saying:

“Danger in the races of officers
element in the race. If England can point to the most brilliant feats
of cavalry in military history
has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men. Sport
has
nothing but what is most superficial.”

“It’s not superficial
they say

Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled his smile
revealed nothing more.

“We’ll admit

with whom he was talking seriously; “we mustn’t forget that those who
are taking part in the race are military men

“No
Betsy. “Isn’t it

“It is upsetting
“If I’d been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus.”

Anna said nothing
same spot.

At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion. Breaking off
what he was saying
dignity

“You’re not racing?” the officer asked

“My race is a harder one
deferentially.

And though the answer meant nothing
had heard a witty remark from a witty man

“There are two aspects

unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator

“Princess
addressing Betsy. “Who’s your favorite?”

“Anna and I are for Kuzovlev

“I’m for Vronsky. A pair of gloves?”

“Done!”

“But it is a pretty sight

Alexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him
began again directly.

“I admit that manly sports do not....” he was continuing.

But at that moment the racers started
Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent
towards the stream. Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race
and so he did not watch the racers
spectators with his weary eyes. His eyes rested upon Anna.

Her face was white and set. She was obviously seeing nothing and no one
but one man. Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan
her breath. He looked at her and hastily turned away
other faces.

“But here’s this lady too
very natural
at her
face again
against his own will
know.

The first fall—Kuzovlev’s
Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna’s pale
man she was watching had not fallen. When
had cleared the worst barrier
straight on his head at it and fatally injured
passed over the whole public
not even notice it
talking of about her. But more and more often

She glanced round for an instant
slight frown turned away again.

“Ah
glance at him again.

The race was an unlucky one
it more than half were thrown and hurt. Towards the end of the race
everyone was in a state of agitation
that the Tsar was displeased.


Chapter 29

Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation
phrase someone had uttered—“The lions and gladiators will be the next
thing
to the ground
way in it. But afterwards a change came over Anna’s face which really
was beyond decorum. She utterly lost her head. She began fluttering
like a caged bird
the next turned to Betsy.

“Let us go

But Betsy did not hear her. She was bending down
who had come up to her.

Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her his
arm.

“Let us go
the general and did not notice her husband.

“He’s broken his leg too
is beyond everything.”

Without answering her husband
towards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off
there was such a crowd of people about it
nothing. She laid down the opera-glass
at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the
Tsar. Anna craned forward

“Stiva! Stiva!” she cried to her brother.

But her brother did not hear her. Again she would have moved away.

“Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going
Alexandrovitch

She drew back from him with aversion
answered:

“No

She saw now that from the place of Vronsky’s accident an officer was
running across the course towards the pavilion. Betsy waved her
handkerchief to him. The officer brought the news that the rider was
not killed

On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly
Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping
her tears
Alexandrovitch stood so as to screen her
herself.

“For the third time I offer you my arm
time
Princess Betsy came to her rescue.

“No
home

“Excuse me
very firmly in the face
wish her to come home with me.”

Anna looked about her in a frightened way
laid her hand on her husband’s arm.

“I’ll send to him and find out
her.

As they left the pavilion
those he met
utterly beside herself
though in a dream.

“Is he killed or not? Is it true? Will he come or not? Shall I see him
today?” she was thinking.

She took her seat in her husband’s carriage in silence
drove out of the crowd of carriages. In spite of all he had seen
Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his
wife’s real condition. He merely saw the outward symptoms. He saw that
she was behaving unbecomingly
so. But it was very difficult for him not to say more
nothing but that. He opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved
unbecomingly

“What an inclination we all have
he said. “I observe....”

“Eh? I don’t understand

He was offended

“I am obliged to tell you

“So now we are to have it out

“I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming
today

“In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?” she said aloud
her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face
bright expression that seemed covering something
determination
was feeling.

“Mind

He got up and pulled up the window.

“What did you consider unbecoming?” she repeated.

“The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the
riders.”

He waited for her to answer
before her.

“I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even
malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you. There was a time
when I spoke of your inward attitude
now. Now I speak only of your external attitude. You have behaved
improperly

She did not hear half of what he was saying; she felt panic-stricken
before him
killed. Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was
unhurt
pretense of irony when he finished
not heard what he said. Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak
boldly
she was feeling infected him too. He saw the smile
misapprehension came over him.

“She is smiling at my suspicions. Yes
she told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions
it’s absurd.”

At that moment
there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer
mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly
groundless. So terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready
to believe anything. But the expression of her face
did not now promise even deception.

“Possibly I was mistaken

“No
into his cold face. “You were not mistaken. I was
being in despair. I hear you
am his mistress; I can’t bear you; I’m afraid of you
you.... You can do what you like to me.”

And dropping back into the corner of the carriage
hiding her face in her hands. Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir
kept looking straight before him. But his whole face suddenly bore the
solemn rigidity of the dead
the whole time of the drive home. On reaching the house he turned his
head to her

“Very well! But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of
propriety till such time”—his voice shook—“as I may take measures to
secure my honor and communicate them to you.”

He got out first and helped her to get out. Before the servants he
pressed her hand
Petersburg. Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy
and brought Anna a note.

“I sent to Alexey to find out how he is
well and unhurt

“So _he_ will be here
all!”

She glanced at her watch. She had still three hours to wait
memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame.

“My God
and I do love this fantastic light.... My husband! Oh! yes.... Well
thank God! everything’s over with him.”


Chapter 30

In the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had
betaken themselves
together
society went on
and unalterable place. Just as the particle of water in frost
definitely and unalterably
snow
in his special place.

_Fürst_ Shtcherbatsky
they took
immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them.

There was visiting the watering-place that year a real German Fürstin
in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more
vigorously than ever. Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished
everything
day after their arrival she duly performed this rite. Kitty made a low
and graceful curtsey in the _very simple_
frock that had been ordered her from Paris. The German princess said
“I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face
for the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once
laid down from which there was no departing. The Shtcherbatskys made
the acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody
a German countess and her son
learned Swede
Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady
Marya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter
because she had fallen ill
Moscow colonel
uniform and epaulets
neck and flowered cravat
because there was no getting rid of him. When all this was so firmly
established
prince went away to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother.
She took no interest in the people she knew
would come of them. Her chief mental interest in the watering-place
consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not
know. It was characteristic of Kitty that she always imagined
everything in people in the most favorable light possible
so in those she did not know. And now as she made surmises as to who
people were
were like
characters

Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who
had come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady
Stahl
society
exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an
invalid carriage. But it was not so much from ill-health as from
pride—so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it—that Madame Stahl had
not made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there. The
Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl
Kitty observed
seriously ill
after them in the most natural way. This Russian girl was not
gathered
Stahl called her Varenka
Varenka.” Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl’s relations
with Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons
happened
was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her.

Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first
youth
have been taken for nineteen or for thirty. If her features were
criticized separately
the sickly hue of her face. She would have been a good figure
it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head
which was too large for her medium height. But she was not likely to be
attractive to men. She was like a fine flower
and without fragrance
Moreover
just what Kitty had too much of—of the suppressed fire of vitality
the consciousness of her own attractiveness.

She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt
and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it. It
was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the
great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka. Kitty felt that in her
her manner of life
painfully seeking: interest in life
worldly relations of girls with men
appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a
purchaser. The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend
more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied
her

The two girls used to meet several times a day
met
exquisite creature I imagine you to be? But for goodness’ sake don’t
suppose
simply admire you and like you.” “I like you too
sweet. And I should like you better still
eyes of the unknown girl. Kitty saw indeed
Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the
springs
it
cakes for tea for someone.

Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the
morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and
unfavorable attention. These were a tall man with a stooping figure
and huge hands
and yet terrible eyes
and tastelessly dressed. Recognizing these persons as Russians
had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and
touching romance about them. But the princess
the visitors’ list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna
explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was
about these two people vanished. Not so much from what her mother told
her
suddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant. This Levin
continual twitching of his head
feeling of disgust.

It seemed to her that his big
pursued her
to avoid meeting him.


Chapter 31

It was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning
invalids

Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel
and jaunty in his European coat
were walking on one side of the arcade
walking on the other side. Varenka
with a turn-down brim
arcade with a blind Frenchwoman
exchanged friendly glances.

“Mamma
friend
might come there together.

“Oh
acquaintance myself
of the way? A companion
acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her _belle-sœur_
the princess

Kitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed
to avoid making her acquaintance. Kitty did not insist.

“How wonderfully sweet she is!” she said
handed a glass to the Frenchwoman. “Look how natural and sweet it all
is.”

“It’s so funny to see your _engouements_
better go back
companion and a German doctor
angrily.

They turned to go back
shouting. Levin
doctor
Kitty beat a hasty retreat
out what was the matter.

A few minutes later the colonel overtook them.

“What was it?” inquired the princess.

“Scandalous and disgraceful!” answered the colonel. “The one thing to
be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad. That tall gentleman was abusing
the doctor
treating him quite as he liked
It’s simply a scandal!”

“Oh

“Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...
intervened. A Russian lady

“Mademoiselle Varenka?” asked Kitty.

“Yes
the arm and led him away.”

“There
her.”

The next day
Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his
companion as with her other _protégés_. She went up to them
into conversation with them
who could not speak any foreign language.

Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make
friends with Varenka. And
seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of
Madame Stahl
about Varenka
prove that there could be no harm though little good in the
acquaintance
her.

Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring
had stopped outside the baker’s

“Allow me to make your acquaintance
smile. “My daughter has lost her heart to you
do not know me. I am....”

“That feeling is more than reciprocal
hurriedly.

“What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!” said the
princess.

Varenka flushed a little. “I don’t remember. I don’t think I did
anything

“Why

“Yes
ill
such invalids.”

“Yes
Stahl: I used to know her _belle-sœur_.”

“No
I was brought up by her

This was so simply said
expression of her face
a fancy to Varenka.

“Well

“He’s going away

At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that
her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.

“Well
Mademoiselle....”

“Varenka

Kitty blushed with pleasure
new friend’s hand
motionless in her hand. The hand did not respond to her pressure
the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft
rather mournful smile

“I have long wished for this too

“But you are so busy.”

“Oh
had to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls
of an invalid

“Varenka

And Varenka went after them.


Chapter 32

The particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka’s
past and her relations with Madame Stahl were as follows:

Madame Stahl
out of his life
by his immoral behavior
enthusiastic temperament. When
she gave birth to her only child
immediately
and fearing the news would kill her
baby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg
daughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household. This was Varenka.
Madame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her own child
she went on bringing her up
had not a relation of her own living. Madame Stahl had now been living
more than ten years continuously abroad
her couch. And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her social
position as a philanthropic
she really was at heart the highly ethical being
but the good of her fellow creatures
be. No one knew what her faith was—Catholic
But one fact was indubitable—she was in amicable relations with the
highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects.

Varenka lived with her all the while abroad
Madame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka
her.

Having learned all these facts
in her daughter’s intimacy with Varenka
breeding and education were of the best—she spoke French and English
extremely well—and what was of the most weight
Madame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill
health from making the acquaintance of the princess.

After getting to know Varenka
her friend

The princess
and sing to them in the evening.

“Kitty plays
will give us so much pleasure
smile
that Varenka had no inclination to sing. Varenka came
evening and brought a roll of music with her. The princess had invited
Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.

Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did
not know
herself
well

“You have an extraordinary talent
Varenka had sung the first song extremely well.

Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and
admiration.

“Look
has collected to listen to you.” There actually was quite a
considerable crowd under the windows.

“I am very glad it gives you pleasure

Kitty looked with pride at her friend. She was enchanted by her talent
and her voice
Varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved
by their praises. She seemed only to be asking: “Am I to sing again
is that enough?”

“If it had been I
delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows! But
she’s utterly unmoved by it. Her only motive is to avoid refusing and
to please mamma. What is there in her? What is it gives her the power
to look down on everything
I should like to know it and to learn it of her!” thought Kitty
into her serene face. The princess asked Varenka to sing again
Varenka sang another song
standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin
dark-skinned hand.

The next song in the book was an Italian one. Kitty played the opening
bars

“Let’s skip that
rest on Varenka’s face

“Very well
and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.

“No
let’s have that one.” And she sang it just as quietly
as well as the others.

When she had finished
Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the
house.

“Am I right

right.”

“No

Varenka.

“I cared for him
and he married another girl. He’s living now not far from us

felt must once have glowed all over her.

“I didn’t think so? Why

“Oh
I’m very happy. Well
turning towards the house.

“How good you are! how good you are!” cried Kitty
she kissed her. “If I could only be even a little like you!”

“Why should you be like anyone? You’re nice as you are
smiling her gentle

“No
down
isn’t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love
he hasn’t cared for it?...”

“But he didn’t disdain it; I believe he cared for me
dutiful son....”

“Yes

and that her face

“In that case he would have done wrong

“Where is the humiliation? Why

“Worse than wrong—shameful.”

Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty’s hand.

“Why
didn’t care for you

“Of course not; I never said a word
looks

“Why so? I don’t understand. The whole point is whether you love him
now or not

“I hate him; I can’t forgive myself.”

“Why

“The shame

“Oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!” said Varenka. “There
isn’t a girl who hasn’t been through the same. And it’s all so
unimportant.”

“Why

“Oh

“Why

“Oh

window. “Kitty

“It really is time to go in!” said Varenka
on to Madame Berthe’s; she asked me to.”

Kitty held her by the hand
her eyes asked her: “What is it
gives you such tranquillity? You know
even know what Kitty’s eyes were asking her. She merely thought that
she had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening
home in time for _maman’s_ tea at twelve o’clock. She went indoors
collected her music

“Allow me to see you home

“Yes

Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that
she needed an escort.

dignity so much to be envied.


Chapter 33

Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too
together with her friendship with Varenka
great influence on her
She found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to
her by means of this acquaintance
with her past
could contemplate her past calmly. It was revealed to her that besides
the instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there
was a spiritual life. This life was disclosed in religion

from childhood

in learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest. This was a lofty
mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and
feelings
told to

Kitty found all this out not from words. Madame Stahl talked to Kitty
as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory
of one’s youth
sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith
of Christ’s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling—and immediately
talked of other things. But in every gesture of Madame Stahl

observations were

but to forget oneself and love others
noble. And that was what Kitty longed to be. Seeing now clearly what
was _the most important_
enthusiastic over it; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul
to the new life that was opening to her. From Varenka’s accounts of the
doings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned

At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the
influence of her _engouement_
still more for Varenka. She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate
Varenka in her conduct
walking
noticed that
change was taking place in her daughter.

The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament
that Madame Stahl had given her—a thing she had never done before; that
she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people
who were under Varenka’s protection
that of a sick painter
the part of a sister of mercy in that family. All this was well enough
and the princess had nothing to say against it
wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman
noticing Kitty’s devotion
consolation. All this would have been very well
exaggeration. But the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into
extremes

“_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_

Her daughter made her no reply
could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned.
What exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein
one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten
one’s cloak if one’s coat were taken? But the princess disliked this
exaggeration
daughter did not care to show her all her heart. Kitty did in fact
conceal her new views and feelings from her mother. She concealed them
not because she did not respect or did not love her mother
because she was her mother. She would have revealed them to anyone
sooner than to her mother.

“How is it Anna Pavlovna’s not been to see us for so long?” the
princess said one day of Madame Petrova. “I’ve asked her
put out about something.”

“No

“Is it long since you went to see them?”

“We’re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow
answered Kitty.

“Well

That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had
changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow. And the
princess noticed again that Kitty reddened.

“Kitty
the princess
the children and coming to see us?”

Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them
could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her. Kitty
answered perfectly truly. She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had
changed to her
could not tell her mother
It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never
speak of even to oneself
mistaken.

Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the
family. She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round
good-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered
their secret confabulations about the invalid
away from the work which was forbidden him
out-of-doors; the devotion of the youngest boy

Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause

that’s it!” Kitty repeated to herself with horror. “No

directly after.

This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.

The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were
completely opposed. The princess thought everything delightful

The prince returned thinner
cheeks

friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka
gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty
prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that
drew his daughter away from him
have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to
him. But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of
kindliness and good humor which was always within him
ever since his course of Carlsbad waters.

The day after his arrival the prince
Russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar
off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.

It was a lovely morning: the bright
gardens
waitresses
they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their
appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions
of prosperous German life. Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.
The bright sun
music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces
with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence
she watched. But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June
morning
fashion
seemed something unseemly and monstrous
slowly moving
Europe. In spite of his feeling of pride and
of youth
almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy
felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd.

“Present me to your new friends

so well again. Only it’s melancholy

Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met
she was acquainted and some not. At the entrance of the garden they met
the blind lady
delighted to see the old Frenchwoman’s face light up when she heard
Kitty’s voice. She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated
politeness
extolling Kitty to the skies before her face

“Well
calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.”

“Oh! Mademoiselle Varenka
assented.

In the arcade they met Varenka herself. She was walking rapidly towards
them carrying an elegant red bag.

“Here is papa come

Varenka made—simply and naturally as she did everything—a movement
between a bow and a curtsey

“Of course I know you; I know you very well

her friend. “Where are you off to in such haste?”

“Maman’s here

“So that’s angel number one?” said the prince when Varenka had gone on.

Kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka

“Well

Petrov got up

“What did you send word to the princess that we weren’t going for?” the

angrily to Varenka

“To do good

“Yes. She took to her bed before my eyes

“She doesn’t stand up because her legs are too short. She’s a very bad
figure.”

“Oh

“Perhaps so
it’s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one
knows.”

could Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl.

The prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his
friends
Shtcherbatskys were staying.

On coming back with Kitty from the springs

Kitty was glad of all this
could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his
good-humored view of her friends

the Petrovs
that morning. Everyone was good-humored

Kitty did not speak.

“When shall I see you again?” asked Varenka.

“Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs. Won’t you be there?” said
Kitty

“Yes
promised to help them pack.”

“Well

“No

“Why not? why not? why not?” said Kitty
clutching at Varenka’s parasol

“Oh
at your helping.”

“No
don’t want me to—why not?”

“I didn’t say that

“No

“Tell you everything?” asked Varenka.

“Everything

“Well
Alexeyevitch” (that was the artist’s name) “had meant to leave earlier
and now he doesn’t want to go away

“Well

“Well
to go because you are here. Of course
a dispute over it—over you. You know how irritable these sick people
are.”

Kitty
speaking alone
coming—she did not know whether of tears or of words.

“So you’d better not go.... You understand; you won’t be offended?...”

“And it serves me right! And it serves me right!” Kitty cried quickly
snatching the parasol out of Varenka’s hand
friend’s face.

Varenka felt inclined to smile
was afraid of wounding her.

“How does it serve you right? I don’t understand

“It serves me right
on purpose
with outsiders? And so it’s come about that I’m a cause of quarrel
that I’ve done what nobody asked me to do. Because it was all a sham! a
sham! a sham!...”

“A sham! with what object?” said Varenka gently.

“Oh
Nothing but sham!” she said

“But with what object?”

“To seem better to people
now I won’t descend to that. I’ll be bad; but anyway not a liar
cheat.”

“But who is a cheat?” said Varenka reproachfully. “You speak as if....”

But Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury
finish.

“I don’t talk about you
yes
would never have been if I weren’t bad. So let me be what I am. I won’t
be a sham. What have I to do with Anna Pavlovna? Let them go their way
and me go mine. I can’t be different.... And yet it’s not that
not that.”

“What is not that?” asked Varenka in bewilderment.

“Everything. I can’t act except from the heart
principle. I liked you simply
me

“You are unjust

“But I’m not speaking of other people

Kitty

“What’s the matter? Why are you so red?” her mother and father said to
her with one voice.

“Nothing

“She’s still here
what have I done
do? What am I to say to her?” thought Kitty
doorway.

Varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the
table examining the spring which Kitty had broken. She lifted her head.

“Varenka
“I don’t remember what I said. I....”

“I really didn’t mean to hurt you

Peace was made. But with her father’s coming all the world in which she
had been living was transformed for Kitty. She did not give up
everything she had learned
herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be. Her eyes were
it seemed
without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had
wished to mount. Moreover
the world of sorrow
living. The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable
and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air
Russia
had already gone with her children.

But her affection for Varenka did not wane. As she said good-bye
begged her to come to them in Russia.

“I’ll come when you get married

“I shall never marry.”

“Well

“Well
your promise

The doctor’s prediction was fulfilled. Kitty returned home to Russia
cured. She was not so gay and thoughtless as before
serene. Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to her.






PART THREE


Chapter 1

Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work
of going abroad as he usually did
stay in the country with his brother. In his judgment the best sort of
life was a country life. He had come now to enjoy such a life at his
brother’s. Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him

background of life
Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work

satisfaction and a sense of its utility. To Konstantin Levin the
country was good first because it afforded a field for labor
usefulness of which there could be no doubt. To Sergey Ivanovitch the
country was particularly good
fitting to do nothing. Moreover
peasants rather piqued Konstantin. Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that
he knew and liked the peasantry
which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension
every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of
the peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them. Konstantin Levin
did not like such an attitude to the peasants. To Konstantin the
peasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor

had for the peasant—sucked in probably
milk of his peasant nurse—still as a fellow-worker with him
sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor

peasants

and so too with the peasants. But like or dislike “the people” as
something apart he could not

because he regarded himself as a part of “the people

and could not contrast himself with them. Moreover

and for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice)

loss to answer the question whether he knew “the people” as the
question whether he liked them. For him to say he knew the peasantry
would have been the same as to say he knew men. He was continually
watching and getting to know people of all sorts
peasants
continually observing new points in them
them and forming new ones. With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the
contrary. Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison
with the life he did not like
contradistinction to the class of men he did not like
knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men
generally. In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated
certain aspects of peasant life
but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life. He never changed
his opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them.

In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of
the peasantry
precisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the
peasant—his character
had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject
arguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself.

In Sergey Ivanovitch’s eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow
_with his heart in the right place_ (as he expressed it in French)
with a mind which

With all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained
to him the true import of things
from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily.

Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and
culture
a special faculty for working for the public good. But in the depths of
his heart

he noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch

the public good
was a right thing to take interest in public affairs

observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public
welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to
heart than he did chess problems
new machine.

Besides this
because in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work
on the land
through all he had to do
But though he was taking a holiday now
writing
into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him
liked to have someone to listen to him. His most usual and natural
listener was his brother. And so in spite of the friendliness and
directness of their relations
leaving him alone. Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the
grass in the sun

“You wouldn’t believe
this rural laziness is to me. Not an idea in one’s brain
drum!”

But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him
especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting
dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it
anyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs
them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention
and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough

“Come
Ivanovitch would say to him.

“No
would answer

Early in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna
housekeeper
pickled
talkative young medical student
came to see her. He examined the wrist
delighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch
Koznishev
scandal of the district
district council had fallen. Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively
asked him questions
uttered a few keen and weighty observations
by the young doctor
brother knew so well
eager conversation. After the departure of the doctor
with a fishing rod to the river. Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling
and was

meadows

It was that time of the year
crops of the present year are a certainty
the sowing for next year
all in ear
in gray-green billows in the wind; when the green oats
yellow grass scattered here and there among it
the late-sown fields; when the early buckwheat is already out and
hiding the ground; when the fallow lands
cattle
plough; when from the dry dung-heaps carted onto the fields there comes
at sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadow-sweet
low-lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting
for the mowing

It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the
fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest—every year
recurring
was a splendid one
dewy nights.

The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows.
Sergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods
which were a tangled mass of leaves
old lime tree on the point of flowering
brightly spotted with yellow stipules
year’s saplings brilliant with emerald. Konstantin Levin did not like
talking and hearing about the beauty of nature. Words for him took away
the beauty of what he saw. He assented to what his brother said
could not help beginning to think of other things. When they came out
of the woods
land on the upland
checkered with furrows
parts even ploughed. A string of carts was moving across it. Levin
counted the carts
brought
mowing. He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the
hay-making. On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse.

The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass
and that he might not get his feet wet
brother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the
carp was caught. Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his mowing
grass
the wheels and the horse’s legs
axles and spokes of the wheels. His brother seated himself under a
bush
him up
the wind. The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist
in the dampest spots.

Crossing the meadow
an old man with a swollen eye

“What? taken a stray swarm

“No
is the second swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the lads caught
them. They were ploughing your field. They unyoked the horses and
galloped after them.”

“Well

“Eh
sooner. Well
plenty for the beasts.”

“What do you think about the weather?”

“That’s in God’s hands. Maybe it will be fine.”

Levin went up to his brother.

Sergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing
in the most cheerful frame of mind. Levin saw that
conversation with the doctor
hand
about getting together the mowers for next day
doubts about the mowing

“Well

“Why be in such a hurry? Let’s stay a little. But how wet you are! Even
though one catches nothing
every part of sport
steely water is!” said Sergey Ivanovitch. “These riverside banks always
remind me of the riddle—do you know it? ‘The grass says to the water:
we quiver and we quiver.’”

“I don’t know the riddle


Chapter 3

“Do you know
“It’s beyond everything what’s being done in the district
what this doctor tells me. He’s a very intelligent fellow. And as I’ve
told you before
the meetings
decent people won’t go into it
We pay the money
schools

“Well
can’t! and so there’s no help for it.”

“But why can’t you? I must own I can’t make it out. Indifference
incapacity—I won’t admit; surely it’s not simply laziness?”

“None of those things. I’ve tried
Levin.

He had hardly grasped what his brother was saying. Looking towards the
plough land across the river
not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback.

“Why is it you can do nothing? You made an attempt and didn’t succeed
as you think
self-respect?”

“Self-respect!” said Levin
“I don’t understand. If they’d told me at college that other people
understood the integral calculus
come in. But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has
certain qualifications for this sort of business
all this business is of great importance.”

“What! do you mean to say it’s not of importance?” said Sergey
Ivanovitch
anything of no importance that interested him
obviously paying little attention to what he was saying.

“I don’t think it important; it does not take hold of me
it
that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed
land. They were turning the plough over. “Can they have finished
ploughing?” he wondered.

“Come
handsome
to be original and genuine
know all about that; but really
meaning
of no importance whether the peasant

“I never did assert it

“...dies without help? The ignorant peasant-women starve the children
and the people stagnate in darkness
every village clerk
them

And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative: either you are so
undeveloped that you can’t see all that you can do
sacrifice your ease

Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to
submit
mortified him and hurt his feelings.

“It’s both

“What! was it impossible
provide medical aid?”

“Impossible
of our district
the fields
over. And besides

“Oh
instances.... But the schools

“Why have schools?”

“What do you mean? Can there be two opinions of the advantage of
education? If it’s a good thing for you
everyone.”

Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall
got hot
indifference to public business.

“Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about
establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of
to which I shall never send my children
don’t want to send their children
that they ought to send them?” said he.

Sergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of
the subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack. He was silent
for a little
brother smiling.

“Come
ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.”

“Oh

“That remains to be proved.... Next
is as a workman of more use and value to you.”

“No
decision
workman. And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as
they put up bridges they’re stolen.”

“Still
disliked contradiction
skipping from one thing to another
points
that education is a benefit for the people?”

“Yes
immediately that he had said what he did not think. He felt that if he
admitted that
rubbish. How it would be proved he could not tell
this would inevitably be logically proved to him
proofs.

The argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected.

“If you admit that it is a benefit
an honest man
the movement

“But I still do not admit this movement to be just
Levin

“What! But you said just now....”

“That’s to say

“That you can’t tell without making the trial.”

“Well
at all
I’m to worry myself about it for.”

“How so?”

“No; since we are talking
point of view

“I can’t see where philosophy comes in
tone
talk about philosophy. And that irritated Levin.

“I’ll tell you
all our actions is
institutions I
prosperity
horses carry me well enough over bad ones. Doctors and dispensaries are
no use to me. An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me. I never appeal
to him
but positively harmful
simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three
acres
of idiocy and loathsomeness
inducement.”

“Excuse me
did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs
work for it.”

“No!” Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; “the
emancipation of the serfs was a different matter. There self-interest
did come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us
decent people among us. But to be a town councilor and discuss how many
dustmen are needed
in which I don’t live—to serve on a jury and try a peasant who’s stolen
a flitch of bacon
of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution
president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka
prisoner in the dock

Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject
president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was
all to the point.

But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.

“Well

“I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest
I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made
raids on us students
defend those rights to the utmost
freedom. I can understand compulsory military service
children
concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of
district council money
understand

Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst
open. Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.

“But tomorrow it’ll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your
tastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal?”

“I’m not going to be tried. I shan’t murder anybody
of it. Well
subject quite beside the point
the rest of it—it’s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground
on Trinity Day
of itself in Europe
believe in them.”

Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders
his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that
point

“Excuse me
observed.

But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing
which he was conscious
went on.

“I imagine
if it is not founded on self-interest
philosophical principle
with determination
as anyone else to talk of philosophy.

Sergey Ivanovitch smiled. “He too has a philosophy of his own at the
service of his natural tendencies

“Come
of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the
indispensable connection which exists between individual and social
interests. But that’s not to the point; what is to the point is a
correction I must make in your comparison. The birches are not simply
stuck in
carefully with them. It’s only those peoples that have an intuitive
sense of what’s of importance and significance in their institutions
and know how to value them
those peoples that one can truly call historical.”

And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of
philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him
showed him all the incorrectness of his view.

“As for your dislike of it
Russian sloth and old serf-owner’s ways
it’s a temporary error and will pass.”

Konstantin was silent. He felt himself vanquished on all sides
felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to
his brother. Only he could not make up his mind whether it was
unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning
clearly
But he did not pursue the speculation
musing on a quite different and personal matter.

Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line
drove off.


Chapter 4

The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with
his brother was this. Once in a previous year he had gone to look at
the mowing
his favorite means for regaining his temper
peasant and began mowing.

He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at
mowing since. He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house
and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for
mowing for whole days together with the peasants. Ever since his
brother’s arrival
loath to leave his brother alone all day long
brother would laugh at him about it. But as he drove into the meadow
and recalled the sensations of mowing
would go mowing. After the irritating discussion with his brother
pondered over this intention again.

“I must have physical exercise
he thought
might feel about it with his brother or the peasants.

Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house
directions as to the work to be done
summon the mowers for the morrow
largest and best of his grass lands.

“And send my scythe
round tomorrow. I shall maybe do some mowing myself too
trying not to be embarrassed.

The bailiff smiled and said: “Yes

At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother:

“I fancy the fine weather will last. Tomorrow I shall start mowing.”

“I’m so fond of that form of field labor

“I’m awfully fond of it. I sometimes mow myself with the peasants
tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.”

Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head
brother.

“How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants

“Yes

“It’s splendid as exercise
said Sergey Ivanovitch

“I’ve tried it. It’s hard work at first
say I shall manage to keep it up....”

“Really! what an idea! But tell me
suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master’s being such a
queer fish?”

“No
such hard work

“But how will you do about dining with them? To send you a bottle of
Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.”

“No

Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual
detained giving directions on the farm
grass the mowers were already at their second row.

From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the
meadow below
of coats
started cutting.

Gradually
some in coats
long string
of them.

They were mowing slowly over the uneven
where there had been an old dam. Levin recognized some of his own men.
Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock
swing a scythe; there was a young fellow
coachman of Levin’s
Tit
was in front of all
playing with the scythe.

Levin got off his mare
meet Tit

“It’s ready
off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe.

Levin took the scythe
rows
after another
stared at him
wrinkled
into the road and accosted him.

“Look’ee now
go!” he said

“I’ll try not to let it go
waiting for the time to begin.

“Mind’ee

Tit made room
to the road
and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him
first moments
heard voices:

“It’s not set right; handle’s too high; see how he has to stoop to it
said one.

“Press more on the heel

“Never mind

“He’s made a start.... You swing it too wide
out.... The master
missed out! For such work us fellows would catch it!”

The grass became softer
followed Tit
paces. Tit kept moving on
weariness
able to keep it up: he was so tired.

He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his
strength
very moment Tit stopped of his own accord
some grass
straightened himself
him came a peasant
once without waiting to mow up to Levin
Tit sharpened his scythe and Levin’s
it was just the same. Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his
scythe
him
the moment came when he felt he had no strength left
moment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.

So they mowed the first row. And this long row seemed particularly hard
work to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit
scythe
his heels in the cut grass
the space he had cut
his face and fell in drops down his nose
though he had been soaked in water
him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.

His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut. “I will
swing less with my arm and more with my whole body
comparing Tit’s row
with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.

The first row
probably wishing to put his master to the test
be a long one. The next rows were easier
every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.

He thought of nothing
the peasants
but the swish of scythes
mowing away
flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his
scythe

Suddenly
or whence it came
moist shoulders. He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the
scythes. A heavy
were falling. Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on;
others—just like Levin himself—merely shrugged their shoulders
enjoying the pleasant coolness of it.

Another row
with good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost all sense of time
could not have told whether it was late or early now. A change began to
come over his work
of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was
doing
was almost as smooth and well cut as Tit’s. But so soon as he
recollected what he was doing
once conscious of all the difficulty of his task
mown.

On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the
meadow again to begin the next
old man said something in a low voice to him. They both looked at the
sun. “What are they talking about
Levin
hours without stopping

“Lunch

“Is it really time? That’s right; lunch

Levin gave his scythe to Tit
crossing the long stretch of mown grass
to get their bread from the heap of coats
Only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about
the weather and the rain was drenching his hay.

“The hay will be spoiled

“Not a bit of it
weather!” said the old man.

Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee. Sergey Ivanovitch
was only just getting up. When he had drunk his coffee
again to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and
come down to the dining-room.


Chapter 5

After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as
before
and now invited him to be his neighbor
only been married in the autumn
first time.

The old man
turned out
regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging
one’s arms in walking
high
scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass.

Behind Levin came the lad Mishka. His pretty
of fresh grass bound round his hair
whenever anyone looked at him he smiled. He would clearly have died
sooner than own it was hard work for him.

Levin kept between them. In the very heat of the day the mowing did not
seem such hard work to him. The perspiration with which he was drenched
cooled him
arms
and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness
it was possible not to think what one was doing. The scythe cut of
itself. These were happy moments. Still more delightful were the
moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended
man rubbed his scythe with the wet
the fresh water of the stream
offered Levin a drink.

“What do you say to my home-brew

And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water
with green bits floating in it
dipper. And immediately after this came the delicious
with his hand on the scythe
streaming sweat
string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the
country.

The longer Levin mowed
unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe
but the scythe mowing of itself
of its own
turned out regular and well-finished of itself. These were the most
blissful moments.

It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion
become unconscious
a tuft of sorrel. The old man did this easily. When a hillock came he
changed his action
the tip of his scythe
strokes. And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what
came into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or
offered it to Levin
scythe
under the scythe
it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it
away.

For both Levin and the young peasant behind him
position were difficult. Both of them
the same strained movement
incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what
was before them.

Levin did not notice how time was passing. If he had been asked how
long he had been working he would have said half an hour—and it was
getting on for dinner time. As they were walking back over the cut
grass
boys who were coming from different directions
the long grass
of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour
rye-beer

“Look’ee
he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun. They mowed two
more rows; the old man stopped.

“Come
stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their
pile of coats
sitting waiting for them. The peasants gathered into groups—those
further away under a cart

Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.

All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago. The peasants
got ready for dinner. Some washed
others made a place comfortable for a rest
bread
some bread in a cup
water on it from the dipper
seasoned it with salt

“Come

The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home. He dined
with the old man
the keenest interest in them
all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man. He felt
much nearer to him than to his brother
the affection he felt for this man. When the old man got up again
his prayer
head for a pillow
flies that were so persistent in the sunshine
tickled his hot face and body
when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him.
The old man had been awake a long while
the scythes of the younger lads.

Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place
so changed. The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was
sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance
sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun. And the
bushes about the river had been cut down
visible before
ascending
the meadow
perfectly new. Raising himself
been cut and how much more could still be done that day.

The work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men. They had cut
the whole of the big meadow
taken thirty scythes two days to mow. Only the corners remained to do
where the rows were short. But Levin felt a longing to get as much
mowing done that day as possible
quickly in the sky. He felt no weariness; all he wanted was to get his
work done more and more quickly and as much done as possible.

“Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?—what do you think?” he said to the
old man.

“As God wills

At the afternoon rest
smoked had lighted their pipes
Upland’s to be cut—there’ll be some vodka.”

“Why not cut it? Come on
Come on!” cried voices
to work.

“Come

“Get along
overtaking him

And young and old mowed away
another. But however fast they worked
and the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly. The little piece
left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes. The last of the
mowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their
coats onto their shoulders
Upland.

The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their
jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland. The grass
was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow
feathery
heart’s-ease.

After a brief consultation—whether to take the rows lengthwise or
diagonally—Prohor Yermilin
peasant
started mowing
going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of
the forest. The sun sank behind the forest. The dew was falling by now;
the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside
mist was rising
dewy shade. The work went rapidly. The grass cut with a juicy sound
and was at once laid in high
brought closer together in the short row
the sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes
whetstones sharpening them

Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man. The old
man
good-humored
were continually cutting with their scythes the so-called “birch
mushrooms
down every time he came across a mushroom
his bosom. “Another present for my old woman

Easy as it was to mow the wet
and down the steep sides of the ravine. But this did not trouble the
old man. Swinging his scythe just as ever

his whole frame trembled with effort

fall

what he had to do. He felt as though some external force were moving
him.


Chapter 6

Mashkin Upland was mown
their coats and were gaily trudging home. Levin got on his horse and
parting regretfully from the peasants
he looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from
the valley; he could only hear rough
and the sound of clanking scythes.

Sergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner
lemon and water in his own room
which he had only just received by post

forehead

“We mowed the whole meadow! Oh
been getting on?” said Levin
conversation of the previous day.

“Mercy! what do you look like!” said Sergey Ivanovitch
moment looking round with some dissatisfaction. “And the door
the door!” he cried. “You must have let in a dozen at least.”

Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies
opened the window except at night

“Not one
believe what a pleasure it is! How have you spent the day?”

“Very well. But have you really been mowing the whole day? I expect
you’re as hungry as a wolf. Kouzma has got everything ready for you.”

“No
go and wash.”

“Yes
Ivanovitch
make haste
to go too. He
his brother’s side. “But what did you do while it was raining?”

“Rain? Why
nice day too? That’s first-rate.” And Levin went off to change his
clothes.

Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining-room. Although it
seemed to Levin that he was not hungry
simply so as not to hurt Kouzma’s feelings
the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good. Sergey Ivanovitch
watched him with a smile.

“Oh
down

The letter was from Oblonsky. Levin read it aloud. Oblonsky wrote to
him from Petersburg: “I have had a letter from Dolly; she’s at
Ergushovo
her
so glad to see you. She’s quite alone
all of them are still abroad.”

“That’s capital! I will certainly ride over to her
we’ll go together. She’s such a splendid woman

“They’re not far from here

“Twenty-five miles. Or perhaps it is thirty. But a capital road.
Capital

“I shall be delighted
sight of his younger brother’s appearance had immediately put him in a
good humor.

“Maybe so; but anyway it’s a pleasure such as I have never known in my
life. And there’s no harm in it

“Altogether

“Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And such a splendid old man
I made friends with there! You can’t fancy how delightful he was!”

“Well
two chess problems
it you. And then—I thought over our conversation yesterday.”

“Eh! our conversation yesterday?” said Levin

absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was
about.

“I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts to

Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word
did not want to understand. He was only afraid his brother might ask
him some question which would make it evident he had not heard.

“So that’s what I think it is
touching him on the shoulder.

“Yes

Stephan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural
and essential official duty—so familiar to everyone in the government

spend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo
for both of them.

The first days of her existence in the country were very hard for
Dolly. She used to stay in the country as a child

The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain

kitchen maid to be found; of the nine cows

could get no fowls; old

On the Sunday in St. Peter’s week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass for
all her children to take the sacrament. Darya Alexandrovna in her
intimate
friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in
regard to religion. She had a strange religion of transmigration of
souls all her own
little about the dogmas of the Church. But in her family she was strict
in carrying out all that was required by the Church—and not merely in
order to set an example
the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried
her extremely
Philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer.

For several days before
how to dress all the children. Frocks were made or altered and washed
seams and flounces were let out
ready. One dress
cost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper. The English governess in
altering it had made the seams in the wrong place
sleeves too much
Tanya’s shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her. But Marya
Philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets
little shoulder-cape. The dress was set right
quarrel with the English governess. On the morning
happily arranged
asked the priest to wait for them for the mass—the children in their
new dresses
waiting for their mother.

To the carriage

Darya Alexandrovna had done her hair
excitement. In the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look
pretty and be admired. Later on
and more distasteful to her. She saw that she was losing her good
looks. But now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again.
Now she did not dress for her own sake
beauty
might not spoil the general effect. And looking at herself for the last
time in the looking-glass she was satisfied with herself. She looked
nice. Not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a
ball

In the church there was no one but the peasants
women-folk. But Darya Alexandrovna saw
sensation produced by her children and her. The children were not only
beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses
charming in the way they behaved. Aliosha
quite correctly; he kept turning round

On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened
and were very sedate.

Everything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began
whistling
governess
not have let things go so far on such a day had she been present; but
she had to support the English governess’s authority
her decision that Grisha should have no tart. This rather spoiled the
general good humor. Grisha cried
too
didn’t care—but at being unjustly treated. This was really too tragic
and Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the English
governess to forgive Grisha

The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the
drawing-room; beside him was standing Tanya with a plate. On the
pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls
governess’s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery
had taken it instead to her brother. While still weeping over the
injustice of his punishment
through his sobs

Tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha

On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed

and

“Mercy! Your new white frock! Tanya! Grisha!” said their mother
to save the frock

The new frocks were taken off
girls to have their blouses put on

bathing. A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery
ceased till they had set off for the bathing-place.

They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found a birch
mushroom. It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and
pointed them out to her; but this time she found a big one quite of
herself

Then they reached the river
went to the bathing-place. The coachman
who kept whisking away the flies
grass
never-ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him
from the bathing-place.

Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain
their wild pranks
and not mix up all the stockings

buttons
believed it to be very good for the children
as bathing with all the children. To go over all those fat little legs

When half the children had been dressed
dress
shyly. Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and
a shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them
Alexandrovna began to talk to the women. At first they laughed behind
their hands and did not understand her questions
bolder and began to talk
the genuine admiration of the children that they showed.

“My
and shaking her head; “but thin....”

“Yes

“And so they’ve been bathing you too

“No; he’s only three months old

“You don’t say so!”

“And have you any children?”

“I’ve had four; I’ve two living—a boy and a girl. I weaned her last
carnival.”

“How old is she?”

“Why

“Why did you nurse her so long?”

“It’s our custom; for three fasts....”

And the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna.
What sort of time did she have? What was the matter with the boy? Where
was her husband? Did it often happen?

Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women
interesting to her was their conversation
all their interests. What pleased her most of all was that she saw
clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so
many children

by the wagonette
them. He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would
be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights
have come from her own husband. Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not
like this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s of foisting his domestic
duties on others. And she was at once aware that Levin was aware of
this. It was just for this fineness of perception
that Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin.

“I know

“What do I know?”

“You know I made an offer and that I was refused
the tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute before was
replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered.

“What makes you suppose I know?”

“Because everybody knows it....”

“That’s just where you are mistaken; I did not know it

“Yes

his heart and set it aching.

“Darya Alexandrovna
some purchase or other
the better.... And there can be no repeating it.”

“Ah
for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling
which only women know. “At the time when you made Kitty an offer she
was just in a position in which she could not answer. She was in doubt.
Doubt between you and Vronsky. Him she was seeing every day
she had not seen for a long while. Supposing she had been older ... I

Levin recalled Kitty’s answer. She had said: “_No

wrong

“I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my
sister

“I don’t know!” said Levin
hurting me. It’s just as if a child of yours were dead
to say to you: He would have been like this and like that
have lived
dead

“How absurd you are!” said Darya Alexandrovna
tenderness at Levin’s excitement. “Yes

“No

“You are very
tenderness into his face. “Very well then
not spoken of this. What have you come for
to the little girl who had come in.

“Where’s my spade

“I speak French

The little girl tried to say it in French
French for spade; the mother prompted her
where to look for the spade. And this made a disagreeable impression on
Levin.

Everything in Darya Alexandrovna’s house and children struck him now as
by no means so charming as a little while before. “And what does she
talk French with the children for?” he thought; “how unnatural and
false it is! And the children feel it so: Learning French and
unlearning sincerity
Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already
even at the cost of some loss of sincerity
teach her children French in that way.

“But why are you going? Do stay a little.”

Levin stayed to tea; but his good-humor had vanished
at ease.

After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in
and
with a troubled face
outside
happiness she had been feeling that day
Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball. Darya Alexandrovna
hearing a scream in the nursery
was pulling Grisha’s hair
beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her. Something
snapped in Darya Alexandrovna’s heart when she saw this. It was as if
darkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children
of hers
positively bad
propensities—wicked children.

She could not talk or think of anything else
to Levin of her misery.

Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her
showed nothing bad
he was thinking in his heart: “No
French with my children; but my children won’t be like that. All one
has to do is not spoil children
they’ll be delightful. No

He said good-bye and drove away


Chapter 11

In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin’s sister’s
estate
how things were going there and on the hay. The chief source of income
on his sister’s estate was from the riverside meadows. In former years
the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three
acres. When Levin took over the management of the estate
examining the grasslands that they were worth more
price at twenty-five roubles the three acres. The peasants would not
give that price
Then Levin had driven over himself
partly by hired labor
the crop. His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of
this new arrangement
meadows had yielded a profit almost double. The previous year—which was
the third year—the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the
arrangement
peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop
village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut
that
divided the crop in his presence
as the owner’s share. From the vague answers to his question how much
hay had been cut on the principal meadow
elder who had made the division
of the peasant
division of the hay
into the matter.

Arriving for dinner at the village

wet-nurse

doing
but gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin’s inquiries about the
mowing. This confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions. He went to
the hay fields and examined the stacks. The haystacks could not
possibly contain fifty wagon-loads each
Levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up
directly
out to be only thirty-two loads in the stack. In spite of the village
elder’s assertions about the compressibility of hay
settled down in the stacks
done in the fear of God
divided without his orders
that hay as fifty loads to a stack. After a prolonged dispute the
matter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks
reckoning them as fifty loads each. The arguments and the division of
the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon. When the last of the hay had
been divided

In front of him

After the women came the men with pitchforks
there were growing up broad
were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared
after another the haycocks vanished
their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging
over the horses’ hind-quarters.

“What weather for haying! What hay it’ll be!” said an old man
squatting down beside Levin. “It’s tea

it.”

“Who’s that? Your son?” asked Levin.

“My baby

“What a fine fellow!”

“The lad’s all right.”

“Married already?”

“Yes

“Any children?”

“Children indeed! Why

as fragrant as tea!” he repeated

Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife. They were
loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him. Ivan Parmenov was

The load was tied on. Ivan jumped down and took the quiet
by the bridle. The young wife flung the rake up on the load

forming a ring for the haymakers’ dance. Ivan drove off to the road and
fell into line with the other loaded carts. The peasant women

in unison.

The women

The storm swooped down
lying
meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the
measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and
clapping. Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he longed
to take part in the expression of this joy of life. But he could do
nothing
their singing
of despondency at his own isolation
alienation from this world

Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with
him over the hay
tried to cheat him
and evidently had not
against him

gave the day
consecrated to labor
labor? What would be its fruits? These were idle considerations—beside
the point.

Often Levin had admired this life
men who led this life; but today for the first time
the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to
his young wife
it was in his power to exchange the dreary
individualistic life he was leading for this laborious
socially delightful life.

The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home; the
people had all separated. Those who lived near had gone home
those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper
spend the night in the meadow. Levin
lay on the haycock
peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all
the short summer night. At first there was the sound of merry talk and
laughing all together over the supper

All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of
heart. Before the early dawn all was hushed. Nothing was to be heard
but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh
the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the
morning. Rousing himself

“Well

had passed through in that brief night. All the thoughts and feelings
he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought. One
was the renunciation of his old life
This renunciation gave him satisfaction
Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he
longed to live now. The simplicity
he felt clearly
the peace
conscious. But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to
effect this transition from the old life to the new. And there nothing
took clear shape for him. “Have a wife? Have work and the necessity of
work? Leave Pokrovskoe? Buy land? Become a member of a peasant
community? Marry a peasant girl? How am I to set about it?” he asked
himself again
night
“I’ll work it out later. One thing’s certain
fate. All my old dreams of home life were absurd
he told himself. “It’s all ever so much simpler and better....”

“How beautiful!” he thought
mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his
head in the middle of the sky. “How exquisite it all is in this
exquisite night! And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?
Just now I looked at the sky
white streaks. Yes

He went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the
village. A slight wind arose

of light over darkness.

Shrinking from the cold

on which he was walking. The shaft-horses were tilted against the
shafts by the ruts

the road.

This was all Levin noticed
gazed absently at the coach.

In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner
evidently only just awake
ribbons of a white cap. With a face full of light and thought
a subtle
gazing beyond him at the glow of the sunrise.

At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing
eyes glanced at him. She recognized him
wondering delight.

He could not be mistaken. There were no other eyes like those in the
world. There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate
for him all the brightness and meaning of life. It was she. It was
Kitty. He understood that she was driving to Ergushovo from the railway
station. And everything that had been stirring Levin during that
sleepless night
He recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl. There

She did not look out again. The sound of the carriage-springs was no
longer audible
showed the carriage had reached the village
the empty fields all round
isolated and apart from it all

He glanced at the sky

that night. There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell.

sky had grown blue and bright; and with the same softness

Chapter 13

None but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew
that
had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character.
Alexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying
without being moved. The sight of tears threw him into a state of
nervous agitation
chief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware
of this
to give way to tears
will get angry
fact
Alexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger.
“I can do nothing. Kindly leave the room!” he would commonly cry in
such cases.

When returning from the races Anna had informed him of her relations
with Vronsky
her face in her hands
in him against her
emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears. Conscious of it
and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would
be out of keeping with the position
manifestation of life in himself
her. This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike
rigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna.

When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage
and making an effort to master himself
usual urbanity
said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision.

His wife’s words
pang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch. That pang was intensified
by the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by her tears.
But when he was all alone in the carriage Alexey Alexandrovitch
surprise and delight
the doubts and agonies of jealousy.

He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after
suffering long from toothache. After a fearful agony and a sense of
something huge
the sufferer
once that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his
attention
take interest in other things besides his tooth. This feeling Alexey
Alexandrovitch was experiencing. The agony had been strange and
terrible
think of something other than his wife.

“No honor
always saw it
to himself. And it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it:
he recalled incidents of their past life
anything wrong before—now these incidents proved clearly that she had
always been a corrupt woman. “I made a mistake in linking my life to
hers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake
unhappy. It’s not I that am to blame
have nothing to do with her. She does not exist for me....”

Everything relating to her and her son
were as much changed as towards her
thing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could
best
justice
him in her fall
and useful existence.

“I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has
committed a crime. I have only to find the best way out of the
difficult position in which she has placed me. And I shall find it
said to himself
last.” And to say nothing of historical instances dating from the “Fair
Helen” of Menelaus
of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the
highest society rose before Alexey Alexandrovitch’s imagination.
“Daryalov
even Dram
Sigonin
quite irrational _ridicule_ falls to the lot of these men
saw anything but a misfortune in it
Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself
fact
the more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives
betraying their husbands
“It is a misfortune which may befall anyone. And this misfortune has
befallen me. The only thing to be done is to make the best of the
position.”

And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had
been in the same position that he was in.

“Daryalov fought a duel....”

The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey
Alexandrovitch in his youth
and was himself well aware of the fact. Alexey Alexandrovitch could not
without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself
had never made use of any weapon in his life. This horror had in his
youth set him pondering on dueling
in which he would have to expose his life to danger. Having attained
success and an established position in the world
forgotten this feeling; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted
itself
Alexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of
dueling in all its aspects
was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances
fight one.

“There’s no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it’s not the same
in England) that very many”—and among these were those whose opinion
Alexey Alexandrovitch particularly valued—“look favorably on the duel;
but what result is attained by it? Suppose I call him out
Alexandrovitch went on to himself
would spend after the challenge
shuddered
Suppose I am taught
trigger
have killed him
his head as though to dispel such silly ideas. “What sense is there in
murdering a man in order to define one’s relation to a guilty wife and
son? I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with
her. But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur—I should
be killed or wounded. I
victim—killed or wounded. It’s even more senseless. But apart from
that
Don’t I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to
fight a duel—would never allow the life of a statesman
Russia
the matter would never come to real danger
simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.
That would be dishonest
myself and others. A duel is quite irrational
me. My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation
the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.” Official duties
had always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s eyes
seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment. Considering
and rejecting the duel
solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered. Passing in
mental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty
of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar)
Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the
object of divorce was that which he had in view. In all these instances
the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife
very party which

conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife’s
guilt
refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought
forward
would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her.

An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal
would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on
his high position in society. His chief object
with the least amount of disturbance possible
divorce either. Moreover
attempt to obtain a divorce
relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover. And in
spite of the complete
felt for his wife
still had one feeling left in regard to her—a disinclination to see her
free to throw in her lot with Vronsky
her advantage. The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey
Alexandrovitch
inward agony
a long while after
bony legs in the fleecy rug.

“Apart from formal divorce
Paskudin
he went on thinking
too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce

The feeling of jealousy

replaced by another

did not acknowledge this feeling
longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind—his
honor. And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a
duel
Alexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution
her with him
every measure in his power to break off the intrigue
more—though this he did not admit to himself—to punish her. “I must
inform her of my conclusion
in which she has placed her family

occurred to Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it. “By such a course
only shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion
told himself. “In adopting this course
wife
the task will be to me
reformation and salvation.”

Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not
exert any moral influence over his wife
reformation could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing
through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking
guidance in religion
seemed to him
sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction
extent restored his peace of mind. He was pleased to think that
in such an important crisis in life
he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion
whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and
indifference. As he pondered over subsequent developments
Alexandrovitch did not see

As he neared Petersburg
entirely to his decision
he would write to his wife. Going into the porter’s room
Alexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his
office

“The horses can be taken out and I will see no one

In his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice

and sat down
on the table
to write

“At our last conversation
communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that
conversation. Having carefully considered everything
with the object of fulfilling that promise. My decision is as follows.
Whatever your conduct may have been
in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power. The

“_P.S._—I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.”





He read the letter through and felt pleased with it
that he had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh word
not a reproach in it
was a golden bridge for return. Folding the letter and smoothing it

Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study
playing with the massive paper-knife
which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the French work on
Egyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun. Over the easy chair there
hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna
celebrated artist. Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it. The
unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him. Insufferably
insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s eyes
of the black lace about the head
the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted
with rings. After looking at the portrait for a minute
Alexandrovitch shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the
sound “brrr
chair and opened the book. He tried to read
the very vivid interest he had felt before in Egyptian hieroglyphics.
He looked at the book and thought of something else. He thought not of
his wife
which at the time constituted the chief interest of it. He felt that he
had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair
and that he had originated a leading idea—he could say it without
self-flattery—calculated to clear up the whole business
him in his official career
of the greatest benefit to the government. Directly the servant had set
the tea and left the room
writing-table. Moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of
papers
a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report
relating to the present complication. The complication was of this
nature: Alexey Alexandrovitch’s characteristic quality as a politician
that special individual qualification that every rising functionary
possesses
reserve
was his contempt for red tape
direct contact
economy. It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had
set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky
province
a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms. Alexey
Alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this. The irrigation of these
lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of
Alexey Alexandrovitch’s predecessor. And vast sums of money had
actually been spent and were still being spent on this business
utterly unproductively
nothing whatever. Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on
entering office

working of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky
province. But in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either.
He demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire
into the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee. The
question of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the
Commission of the 2nd of June
Alexey Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the
deplorable condition of the native tribes. In the commission this
question had been a ground of contention between several departments.
The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the
condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing
proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity
if there were anything wrong
part of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s department to carry out the measures
prescribed by law. Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First
that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to
investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly
if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually
was such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands
of the committee
appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes

Alexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for
his own benefit. Having filled a sheet of paper
sent a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain
necessary facts for him. Getting up and walking about the room

Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky
when he told her their position was impossible
heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable
longed with her whole soul to change it. On the way home from the races
she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement
spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so
After her husband had left her
that now everything was made clear
lying and deception. It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position
was now made clear forever. It might be bad
would be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it.
The pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words
would be rewarded now by everything being made clear
evening she saw Vronsky
between her and her husband
was necessary to tell him.

When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was
what she had said to her husband
awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought
herself to utter those strange
what would come of it. But the words were spoken
Alexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything. “I saw Vronsky
and did not tell him. At the very instant he was going away I would
have turned him back and told him
was strange that I had not told him the first minute. Why was it I
wanted to tell him and did not tell him?” And in answer to this
question a burning blush of shame spread over her face. She knew what
had kept her from it
which had seemed to her simplified the night before
her now as not only not simple
terrified at the disgrace
Directly she thought of what her husband would do
ideas came to her mind. She had a vision of being turned out of the
house
herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house
she could not find an answer.

When she thought of Vronsky
that he was already beginning to be tired of her
offer herself to him
to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband
continually repeated in her imagination
everyone had heard them. She could not bring herself to look those of
her own household in the face. She could not bring herself to call her

The maid
into her room of her own accord. Anna glanced inquiringly into her
face
coming in
clothes and a note. The note was from Betsy. Betsy reminded her that
Liza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with
her that morning with their adorers

she shivered all over

continually
meaning to her. The idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion
was as remote from her as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovitch
himself
had been brought up. She knew that the support of religion was possible
only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole
meaning of life. She was not simply miserable
at the new spiritual condition
found herself. She felt as though everything were beginning to be
double in her soul
over-tired eyes. She hardly knew at times what it was she feared
what she hoped for. Whether she feared or desired what had happened
what was going to happen
not have said.

“Ah

she was holding her hair in both hands
pulling it. She jumped up

“The coffee is ready

“Seryozha? What about Seryozha?” Anna asked
recollecting her son’s existence for the first time that morning.

“He’s been naughty

“In what way?”

“Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room. I think he
slipped in and ate one of them on the sly.”

The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless
condition in which she found herself. She recalled the partly sincere
though greatly exaggerated
which she had taken up of late years
plight in which she found herself she had a support
her relation to her husband or to Vronsky. This support was her son. In
whatever position she might be placed
husband might put her to shame and turn her out
cold to her and go on living his own life apart (she thought of him
again with bitterness and reproach); she could not leave her son. She
had an aim in life. And she must act; act to secure this relation to
her son
quickly as possible
She must take her son and go away. Here was the one thing she had to do
now. She needed consolation. She must be calm

She felt that the tears were coming into her eyes. “Can I help loving
him?” she said to herself

me? Is it possible he will not feel for me?” Tears were already flowing
down her face
on to the terrace.

After the thunder showers of the last few days

Chapter 16

All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters

up in a wrapper fell out of it. She disengaged the letter and began
reading it at the end. “Preparations shall be made for your arrival
here ... I attach particular significance to compliance....” she read.
She ran on

felt that she was cold all over
she had not expected

In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband
and wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken.
And here this letter regarded them as unspoken
had wanted. But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything
she had been able to conceive.

“He’s right!” she said; “of course

She recalled the words from the letter. “You can conjecture what awaits
you and your son....” “That’s a threat to take away my child

She recalled another sentence in the letter. “Our life must go on as it
has done in the past....” “That life was miserable enough in the old
days; it has been awful of late. What will it be now? And he knows all
that; he knows that I can’t repent that I breathe
knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he wants to
go on torturing me. I know him; I know that he’s at home and is happy

to catch me

“But how? My God! my God! Was ever a woman so miserable as I am?...”

“No; I will break through it

writing-table to write him another letter. But at the bottom of her
heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through
anything
position

She sat down at the writing-table
her hands on the table
with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying. She was weeping that
her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been
annihilated forever. She knew beforehand that everything would go on in
the old way
the position in the world that she enjoyed
of so little consequence in the morning
precious to her
for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and
child to join her lover; that however much she might struggle
could not be stronger than herself. She would never know freedom in
love
detection hanging over her at every instant; deceiving her husband for
the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from
her
would be
conceive what it would end in. And she cried without restraint
children cry when they are punished.

The sound of the footman’s steps forced her to rouse herself
hiding her face from him

“The courier asks if there’s an answer

“An answer? Yes

“What can I write?” she thought. “What can I decide upon alone? What do
I know? What do I want? What is there I care for?” Again she felt that
her soul was beginning to be split in two. She was terrified again at
this feeling
which might divert her thoughts from herself. “I ought to see Alexey”
(so she called Vronsky in her thoughts); “no one but he can tell me
what I ought to do. I’ll go to Betsy’s
she said to herself
the day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya’s
said that in that case he should not go either. She went up to the
table
ringing the bell

“We are not going

“Not going at all?”

“No; don’t unpack till tomorrow
to the princess’s.”

“Which dress am I to get ready?”


Chapter 17

The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was
to consist of two ladies and their adorers. These two ladies were the
chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle

utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved. Moreover

world. From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go
hints in Princess Tverskaya’s note referred to her refusal. But now
Anna was eager to go

Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya’s earlier than the other guests.

At the same moment as she entered
side-whiskers combed out like a _Kammerjunker_
at the door
him
that he would not come. Most likely he was sending a note to say so.

As she took off her outer garment in the hall
pronouncing his “_r’s_” even like a _Kammerjunker_
count for the princess

She longed to question him as to where his master was. She longed to
turn back and send him a letter to come and see her
to see him. But neither the first nor the second nor the third course
was possible. Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival
ahead of her
door waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms.

“The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately. Would
you be pleased to walk into the garden?” announced another footman in
another room.

The position of uncertainty
home—worse
impossible to see Vronsky
in company so uncongenial to her present mood. But she was wearing a
dress that she knew suited her. She was not alone; all around was that
luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to
wretched than at home. She was not forced to think what she was to do.
Everything would be done of itself. On meeting Betsy coming towards her
in a white gown that struck her by its elegance
just as she always did. Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch
and a young lady
the provinces

There was probably something unusual about Anna
at once.

“I slept badly
came to meet them

“How glad I am you’ve come!” said Betsy. “I’m tired
longing to have some tea before they come. You might go”—she turned to
Tushkevitch—“with Masha
they’ve been cutting it. We shall have time to talk a little over tea;
we’ll have a cozy chat
pressing the hand with which she held a parasol.

“Yes

Anna than a game of croquet. Anna knew that Betsy knew everything

for a minute that she knew nothing.

“Ah!” said Anna indifferently

Betsy said all this

“I must write to Alexey though

At tea

arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women. They
criticized the people they were expecting
upon Liza Merkalova.

“She’s very sweet

“You ought to like her. She raves about you. Yesterday she came up to
me after the races and was in despair at not finding you. She says
you’re a real heroine of romance

it is.”

“But do tell me

Betsy smiled with her eyes

“It’s a new manner
They’ve flung their caps over the windmills. But there are ways and
ways of flinging them.”

“Yes

Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter
thing which rarely happened with her.

“You’re encroaching on Princess Myakaya’s special domain now. That’s
the question of an _enfant terrible_

infectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often. “You’d
better ask them

“No; you laugh
never could understand it. I can’t understand the husband’s rôle in
it.”

“The husband? Liza Merkalova’s husband carries her shawl
ready to be of use. But anything more than that in reality
cares to inquire. You know in decent society one doesn’t talk or think
even of certain details of the toilet. That’s how it is with this.”

“Will you be at Madame Rolandak’s fête?” asked Anna
conversation.

“I don’t think so
she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea.
Putting a cup before Anna
into a silver holder

“It’s like this

children

“How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!” said

Anna had never met this new star of fashion

soft

step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were
distinctly marked under her dress

she introduced the young man

a stranger. Vaska bowed once more to Anna
He addressed Sappho: “You’ve lost your bet. We got here first. Pay up
said he

Sappho laughed still more festively.

“Not just now

“Oh

“Very well
“I am a nice person ... I positively forgot it ... I’ve brought you a
visitor. And here he comes.” The unexpected young visitor
had invited
such consequence that
his entrance.

He was a new admirer of Sappho’s. He now dogged her footsteps
Vaska.

Soon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived
Liza Merkalova was a thin brunette
face
her dark dress (Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact) was
in perfect harmony with her style of beauty. Liza was as soft and
enervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.

But to Anna’s taste Liza was far more attractive. Betsy had said to
Anna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child

innocent and corrupt
her tone was the same as Sappho’s; that like Sappho

There was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.
This glow shone out in her exquisite
and at the same time passionate

but love her. At the sight of Anna
with a smile of delight.

“Ah

“Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling

The company got up at this moment to go into the garden.

“Oh

“Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored; but

Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young
men. Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea-table.

“What

“Ah

Always the same thing. We lounged about on sofas all the evening. What

Chapter 19

In spite of Vronsky’s apparently frivolous life in society
man who hated irregularity. In early youth in the Corps of Pages
had experienced the humiliation of a refusal
in difficulties
himself in the same position again.

In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order
times a year (more or less frequently
shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape. This
he used to call his day of reckoning or _faire la lessive_.

On waking up the day after the races

he was ill-tempered on such occasions
comrade at the writing-table
getting in his way.

Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the
conditions surrounding him
of these conditions
something exceptional and personal
supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of
personal affairs as he is. So indeed it seemed to Vronsky. And not
without inward pride
man would long ago have been in difficulties
some dishonorable course
position. But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him
to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into
difficulties.

What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary
position. Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he
owed
seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds
sake of clearness. Reckoning up his money and his bank book
that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles
in before the New Year. Reckoning over again his list of debts
copied it
the debts which he would have to pay at once
any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could
not be a moment’s delay in paying. Such debts amounted to about four
thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse
hundred as surety for a young comrade
to a cardsharper in Vronsky’s presence. Vronsky had wanted to pay the
money at the time (he had that amount then)
had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky
That was so far well
though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be
surety for Venovsky
two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the
swindler
most important division he must have four thousand roubles. The second
class—eight thousand roubles—consisted of less important debts. These
were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses

be quite free from anxiety. The last class of debts—to shops
hotels

had one thousand eight hundred. For a man with one hundred thousand
roubles of revenue
such debts
fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand. His father’s

who had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand
a year
now in difficulties. To get out of these difficulties
apply to his mother for money. Her last letter
the day before
that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the
army
His mother’s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him
feel colder than ever to her. But he could not draw back from the
generous word when it was once uttered
vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with Madame
Karenina
that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred
thousand of income. But it was impossible to draw back. He had only to
recall his brother’s wife

and Vronsky determined upon it without an instant’s hesitation: to
borrow money from a money-lender

to sell his race horses. Resolving on this

Chapter 20

Vronsky’s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of
principles
what he ought not to do. This code of principles covered only a very
small circle of contingencies
doubtful
had a moment’s hesitation about doing what he ought to do. These
principles laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a
cardsharper
to a man
one may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult
give one and so on. These principles were possibly not reasonable and
not good
adhered to them
hold his head up. Only quite lately in regard to his relations with
Anna
fully cover all possible contingencies
difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.

His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear
and simple. It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of
principles by which he was guided.

She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him
loved her
the same
his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word
a hint
a woman could look for.

His attitude to society
suspect it
ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the
non-existent honor of the woman he loved.

His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all. From the moment
that Anna loved Vronsky
one thing unassailable. Her husband was simply a superfluous and
tiresome person. No doubt he was in a pitiable position
that be helped? The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand
satisfaction with a weapon in his hand
this at any minute.

But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her
frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness. Only the day before she had
told him that she was with child. And he felt that this fact and what
she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code
of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life. And
he had been indeed caught unawares
spoke to him of her position
leave her husband. He had said that
saw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the
same time
wrong.

“If I told her to leave her husband
with mine; am I prepared for that? How can I take her away now
have no money? Supposing I could arrange.... But how can I take her
away while I’m in the service? If I say that—I ought to be prepared to
do it

And he grew thoughtful. The question whether to retire from the service
or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden
interest of his life

Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood
did not confess even to himself
passion was even doing battle with his love. His first steps in the
world and in the service had been successful

and of the same age
which might have influence on the course of political events; while
Vronsky

Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me

colonel); “they’re expecting you.”

“Yes; is that music at his place?” he said
sounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him. “What’s the fête?”

“Serpuhovskoy’s come.”

“Aha!” said Vronsky

The smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever.

Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love
sacrificed his ambition to it—having anyway taken up this position
Vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of Serpuhovskoy or hurt
with him for not coming first to him when he came to the regiment.
Serpuhovskoy was a good friend

“Ah

The colonel
were in the wide lower balcony. In the courtyard the first objects that
met Vronsky’s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats
standing near a barrel of vodka
the colonel surrounded by officers. He had gone out as far as the first
step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played
Offenbach’s quadrille
soldiers standing on one side. A group of soldiers
and several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky. The colonel
returned to the table

The colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy

It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy. He looked more

detected in him was that subdued
which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of
the recognition of their success by everyone. Vronsky knew that radiant
air

As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky. A smile of pleasure
lighted up his face. He tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in
his hand
could not come to him before the quartermaster
forward his lips ready to be kissed.

“Here he is!” shouted the colonel. “Yashvin told me you were in one of

his pocketbook

“Vronsky! Have anything to eat or drink?” asked Yashvin. “Hi

The fête at the colonel’s lasted a long while. There was a great deal
of drinking. They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again

superiority of Russia over Prussia
there was a lull in the revelry for a moment. Serpuhovskoy went into
the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there;
Vronsky was drenching his head with water. He had taken off his coat
and put his sunburnt

conversation began which was very interesting to both of them.

“The only ones?” Serpuhovskoy queried

“Yes; and I heard news of you
Vronsky

Serpuhovskoy smiled. Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to
him

“Well
very glad. I’m ambitious; that’s my weakness

“Perhaps you wouldn’t confess to it if you hadn’t been successful

“I don’t suppose so

“Perhaps that is true for you

think your action was good in itself

“I didn’t say it did satisfy me.”

“Yes

“By whom?”

“By whom? By society
or else everything goes and will go to the dogs.”

“How do you mean? Bertenev’s party against the Russian communists?”

“No
such an absurdity. “_Tout ça est une blague_. That’s always been and
always will be. There are no communists. But intriguing people have to
invent a noxious
is a powerful party of independent men like you and me.”

“But why so?” Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power. “Why
aren’t they independent men?”

“Simply because they have not
independent fortune; they’ve not had a name
the sun and center as we have. They can be bought either by money or by
favor. And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a
policy. And they bring forward some notion
believe in
to a government house and so much income. _Cela n’est pas plus fin que
ça_
stupider perhaps
But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain
being more difficult to buy. And such men are more needed than ever.”

Vronsky listened attentively
meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already
contemplating a struggle with the existing powers
likes and dislikes in that higher world
governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment.
Vronsky felt
unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in
through his intelligence and gift of words
world in which he moved. And
envious.

“Still I haven’t the one thing of most importance for that
answered; “I haven’t the desire for power. I had it once
gone.”

“Excuse me

“Yes

“Yes
forever.”

“Perhaps

“You say _perhaps_
thoughts
for. Your action was just what it should have been. I see that
ought not to keep it up. I only ask you to give me _carte blanche_. I’m
not going to offer you my protection ... though
I protect you?—you’ve protected me often enough! I should hope our
friendship rises above all that sort of thing. Yes
to him as tenderly as a woman
the regiment

“But you must understand that I want nothing
that all should be as it is.”

Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.

“You say that all should be as it is. I understand what that means. But
listen: we’re the same age
perhaps than I have.” Serpohovskoy’s smile and gestures told Vronsky
that he mustn’t be afraid
touching the sore place. “But I’m married
to know thoroughly one’s wife
one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.”

“We’re coming directly!” Vronsky shouted to an officer
the room and called them to the colonel.

Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey
would say to him.

“And here’s my opinion for you. Women are the chief stumbling block in
a man’s career. It’s hard to love a woman and do anything. There’s only
one way of having love conveniently without its being a
hindrance—that’s marriage. How
Serpuhovskoy
just as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your
hands
And that’s what I felt when I was married. My hands were suddenly set
free. But to drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage
hands will always be so full that you can do nothing. Look at Mazankov
at Krupov. They’ve ruined their careers for the sake of women.”

“What women!” said Vronsky
with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.

“The firmer the woman’s footing in society
much the same as—not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms—but
tearing it away from someone else.”

“You have never loved

“Perhaps. But you remember what I’ve said to you. And another thing
women are all more materialistic than men. We make something immense
out of love

“Directly

brought Vronsky a note.

“A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.”

Vronsky opened the letter

“My head’s begun to ache; I’m going home

“Oh

“We’ll talk about it later on; I’ll look you up in Petersburg.”


Chapter 22

It was six o’clock already
at the same time not to drive with his own horses
Vronsky got into Yashvin’s hired fly
quickly as possible. It was a roomy
four. He sat in one corner
and sank into meditation.

A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought
vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy
who had considered him a man that was needed
anticipation of the interview before him—all blended into a general
joyous sense of life. This feeling was so strong that he could not help
smiling. He dropped his legs
taking it in his hand
had been grazed the day before by his fall
several deep breaths.

“I’m happy
this sense of physical joy in his own body
fond of himself
slight ache in his strong leg
movement in his chest as he breathed. The bright
which had made Anna feel so hopeless
and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water.
The scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly
pleasant in the fresh air. Everything he saw from the carriage window
everything in that cold pure air
as fresh
houses shining in the rays of the setting sun
fences and angles of buildings
carriages that met him now and then
and grass
slanting shadows that fell from the houses
even from the rows of potatoes—everything was bright like a pretty
landscape just finished and freshly varnished.

“Get on

at the lamp

“I want nothing
the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows
picturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time. “And as I
go on
Whereabouts will she be? Where? How? Why did she fix on this place to
meet me
wondering now for the first time at it. But there was now no time for
wonder. He called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue
opening the door
into the avenue that led up to the house. There was no one in the
avenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her. Her face
was hidden by a veil
movement in walking
and the setting of the head
all over him. With fresh force
springy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he
breathed

Joining him

“You’re not angry that I sent for you? I absolutely had to see you
she said; and the serious and set line of her lips
the veil

“I angry! But how have you come

“Never mind
talk to you.”

He saw that something had happened
a joyous one. In her presence he had no will of his own: without
knowing the grounds of her distress
unconsciously passing over him.

“What is it? what?” he asked her
and trying to read her thoughts in her face.

She walked on a few steps in silence
suddenly she stopped.

“I did not tell you yesterday
painfully
everything ... told him I could not be his wife
everything.”

He heard her
though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for
her. But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up
proud and hard expression came over his face.

“Yes
it was
reading his thoughts from the expression of his face. She could not
guess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented
itself to Vronsky—that a duel was now inevitable. The idea of a duel
had never crossed her mind
on this passing expression of hardness.

When she got her husband’s letter
heart that everything would go on in the old way
have the strength of will to forego her position
and to join her lover. The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya’s had
confirmed her still more in this. But this interview was still of the
utmost gravity for her. She hoped that this interview would transform
her position
her resolutely
everything and come with me!” she would give up her son and go away
with him. But this news had not produced what she had expected in him;
he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.

“It was not in the least painful to me. It happened of itself
said irritably; “and see....” she pulled her husband’s letter out of
her glove.

“I understand
but not reading it
for
to devote my life to your happiness.”

“Why do you tell me that?” she said. “Do you suppose I can doubt it? If
I doubted....”

“Who’s that coming?” said Vronsky suddenly
walking towards them. “Perhaps they know us!” and he hurriedly turned
off

“Oh
that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil. “I
tell you that’s not the point—I can’t doubt that; but see what he
writes to me. Read it.” She stood still again.

he would await the injured husband’s shot
into the air. And at that instant there flashed across his mind the
thought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him

himself—and he knew that this thought he could not tell her.

Having read the letter

it before by himself. She knew that whatever he might say to her
would not say all he thought. And she knew that her last hope had
failed her. This was not what she had been reckoning on.

“You see the sort of man he is
“he....”

“Forgive me

to explain his words. “I rejoice
possibly remain as he supposes.”

“Why can’t they?” Anna said
attaching no sort of consequence to what he said. She felt that her
fate was sealed.

Vronsky meant that after the duel—inevitable

“It can’t go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I hope”—he was

She did not let him go on.

“But my child!” she shrieked. “You see what he writes! I should have to

everything has changed for me? For me there is one thing
only—your love. If that’s mine
nothing can be humiliating to me. I am proud of my position
... proud of being ... proud....” She could not say what she was proud
of. Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance. She stood still
and sobbed.

He felt

felt sorry for her

“Is not a divorce possible?” he said feebly. She shook her head
answering. “Couldn’t you take your son

“Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him
shortly. Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had
not deceived her.

On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of
June. Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was

speech he intended to make. But he did not really need these documents.
He remembered every point

he saw his enemy facing him

he could prepare it now. He felt that the import of his speech was of
such magnitude that every word of it would have weight. Meantime

Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had
been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram
Alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival. But when she arrived
he did not meet her. She was told that he had not yet gone out
busy with his secretary. She sent word to her husband that she had
come

directions
there; but he did not come
study as he parted from the chief secretary. She knew that he usually
went out quickly to his office
so that their attitude to one another might be defined.

She walked across the drawing-room and went resolutely to him. When she
went into his study he was in official uniform
out
dejectedly before him. She saw him before he saw her
he was thinking of her.

On seeing her
flushed hotly—a thing Anna had never seen before
and went to meet her
forehead and hair. He went up to her

“I am very glad you have come

preparing herself for meeting him
and reproach him

quite well?” he said

“I had thought of going to Moscow

“No
again.

Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation
herself.

“Alexey Alexandrovitch

bad woman
come to tell you that I can change nothing.”

“I have asked you no question about that
resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face; “that was
as I had supposed.” Under the influence of anger he apparently regained
complete possession of all his faculties. “But as I told you then
have written to you
that I am not bound to know this. I ignore it. Not all wives are so
kind as you
to their husbands.” He laid special emphasis on the word “agreeable.”
“I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it
my name is not disgraced. And so I simply inform you that our relations
must be just as they have always been
your compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my
honor.”

“But our relations cannot be the same as always
voice

When she saw once more those composed gestures
childish
pity for him
make clear her position.

“I cannot be your wife while I....” she began.

He laughed a cold and malignant laugh.

“The manner of life you have chosen is reflected
ideas. I have too much respect or contempt
past and despise your present ... that I was far from the
interpretation you put on my words.”

Anna sighed and bowed her head.

“Though indeed I fail to comprehend how
show

anything reprehensible in performing a wife’s duties in relation to
your husband.”

“Alexey Alexandrovitch! What is it you want of me?”

“I want you not to meet that man here
neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him.
That’s not much
privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties. That’s all
I have to say to you. Now it’s time for me to go. I’m not dining at
home.” He got up and moved towards the door.

Anna got up too. Bowing in silence


Chapter 24

The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for
him. The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and
had lost all attraction for him. In spite of the magnificent harvest
never had there been
been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the
peasants as that year
hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him. The delight he had
experienced in the work itself
with the peasants
to adopt that life
intention
had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had
managed it
not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople
which was the foundation of it all. The herd of improved cows such as
Pava
surrounded with hedges
manured
splendid if only the work had been done for themselves
themselves and comrades—people in sympathy with them. But he saw
clearly now (his work on a book of agriculture
element in husbandry was to have been the laborer
in this) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a
cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers
there was on one side—his side—a continual intense effort to change
everything to a pattern he considered better; on the other side
natural order of things. And in this struggle he saw that with immense
expenditure of force on his side
on the other side
to the liking of either side
and land were spoiled with no good to anyone. Worst of all
expended on this work was not simply wasted. He could not help feeling
now
aim of his energy was a most unworthy one. In reality
struggle about? He was struggling for every farthing of his share (and
he could not help it
would not have had the money to pay his laborers’ wages)

that is to say
that every laborer should work as hard as possible
doing so he should keep his wits about him
the winnowing machines
he should attend to what he was doing. What the laborer wanted was to
work as pleasantly as possible
and heedlessly
step. He sent the men to mow some clover for hay
patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no
use for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover
justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them
to
splendid hay; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so
much easier to mow. He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay—it
was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to
sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him. And he
was told
it quick enough.” The ploughs were practically useless
never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the
plough

consent to be night-watchman

(Nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it.) But now he could
deceive himself no longer. The farming of the land

could take no further interest in it.

be my wife merely because she can’t be the wife of the man she wanted

Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter
Kitty’s use. “I’m told you have a side-saddle
hope you will bring it over yourself.”

This was more than he could stand. How could a woman of any
intelligence

without any reply. To write that he would go was impossible

prevented him

He stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant’s to feed his horses. A

her bare arm to the door into the parlor
her handsome face

“Would you like the samovar?” she asked.

“Yes

“What have they been ploughing?” asked Levin.

“Ploughing up the potatoes. We rent a bit of land too. Fedot

“Oh

“There ... in the outer room

The good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full
pails dragging at her shoulders. More women came on the scene from
somewhere

The samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family
disposed of the horses

“Well
accepting the invitation with pleasure. “But just a glass for company.”

Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man’s farming. Ten years
before
owned them
hundred from a neighboring landowner. A small part of the land—the
worst part—he let out for rent
cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers. The old man
complained that things were doing badly. But Levin saw that he simply
did so from a feeling of propriety

bought land at thirty-five roubles the acre

and his cows

was not averse to new methods either. He had planted a great many
potatoes
already past flowering and beginning to die down
only just coming into flower. He earthed up his potatoes with a modern
plough borrowed from a neighboring landowner. He sowed wheat. The
trifling fact that
thinned out for his horses
Levin seen this splendid fodder wasted
always it had turned out to be impossible. The peasant got this done
and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts.

“What have the wenches to do? They carry it out in bundles to the
roadside

“Well
handing him a glass of tea.

“Thank you

said he. “Look at Sviazhsky’s

“Yes
crossing himself deliberately

When Levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole
family at dinner. The women were standing up waiting on them. The
young
full of pudding
who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl

Very probably the good-looking face of the young woman in the clogs had
a good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant
household made upon Levin
could never get rid of it. And all the way from the old peasant’s to
Sviazhsky’s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were
something in this impression that demanded his special attention.


Chapter 26

Sviazhsky was the marshal of his district. He was five years older than
Levin
liked very much
his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him. He knew
this with certainty
though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone;
and he knew too that
by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife
he could no more have married her
Kitty Shtcherbatskaya
knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to
Sviazhsky.

On getting Sviazhsky’s letter with the invitation for shooting
had immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up his
mind that Sviazhsky’s having such views for him was simply his own
groundless supposition
the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself
the test in regard to this girl. The Sviazhskys’ home-life was
exceedingly pleasant
taking part in local affairs that Levin knew
him.

Sviazhsky was one of those people
whose convictions

direction
contradiction to their convictions. Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced
man. He despised the nobility
be secretly in favor of serfdom
cowardice. He regarded Russia as a ruined country
style of Turkey
permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously
functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility
when he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap
with the red band. He considered human life only tolerable abroad
went abroad to stay at every opportunity
carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia
with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was
being done in Russia. He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a
stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man
the same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands
with the peasants and listen to their opinion. He believed neither in
God nor the devil
improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues
took special trouble to keep up the church in his village.

On the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of
complete liberty for women
lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless
home life was the admiration of everyone
so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her husband’s
efforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as
possible.

If it had not been a characteristic of Levin’s to put the most
favorable interpretation on people
presented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said to himself
“a fool or a knave

about him

Levin tried to understand him
at him and his life as at a living enigma.

all
of alarm were visible in his eyes

Sviazhsky’s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood
was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in
those rural conversations concerning crops

but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of
importance. “It was not

The shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected. The marsh
was dry and there were no grouse at all. He walked about the whole day
and only brought back three birds

accompanied violent physical exertion. And while out shooting
seemed to be thinking of nothing at all

to claim not merely his attention

In the evening at tea
connected with a wardship were of the party
conversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up.

Levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table
to keep up a conversation with her and her sister
opposite him. Madame Sviazhskaya was a round-faced
short woman
solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind; but
he had not complete freedom of ideas
embarrassment. This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the
sister-in-law was sitting opposite to him
on
of a trapeze
of the bosom’s being very white
deprived Levin of the full use of his faculties. He imagined
mistakenly
and felt that he had no right to look at it
it; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the
low-necked bodice having been made. It seemed to Levin that he had
deceived someone
explain it was impossible
blushing
pretty sister-in-law too. But their hostess appeared not to observe
this

“You say
my husband cannot be interested in what’s Russian. It’s quite the
contrary; he is always in cheerful spirits abroad
here. Here
has the faculty of interesting himself in everything. Oh
been to see our school

“I’ve seen it.... The little house covered with ivy

“Yes; that’s Nastia’s work

“Yes; I used to teach in it myself

“No

got up
and walked to the other end of the table
with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood. Sviazhsky was sitting
sideways
with the other hand he gathered up his beard
let it drop again
eyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray
whiskers
gentleman was complaining of the peasants. It was evident to Levin that
Sviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman’s complaints
once demolish his whole contention
not give utterance to this answer
to the landowner’s comic speeches.

The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate
adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist
life in the country. Levin saw proofs of this in his dress
old-fashioned threadbare coat
his shrewd
imperious tone that had become habitual from long use
resolute gestures of his large
betrothal ring on the little finger.


Chapter 27

“If I’d only the heart to throw up what’s been set going ... such a lot
of trouble wasted ... I’d turn my back on the whole business
go off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear _La Belle Hélène_
landowner

“But you see you don’t throw it up
“so there must be something gained.”

“The only gain is that I live in my own house
hired. Besides
instead of that
immorality! They keep chopping and changing their bits of land. Not a
sight of a horse or a cow. The peasant’s dying of hunger
and take him on as a laborer
and then bring you up before the justice of the peace.”

“But then you make complaints to the justice too

“I lodge complaints? Not for anything in the world! Such a talking
such a to-do
instance
justice do? Why
own communal court and their village elder. He’ll flog them in the good
old style! But for that there’d be nothing for it but to give it all up
and run away.”

Obviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky
it

“But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures
he

He indicated the other landowner.

“Yes
done. Do you call that a rational system?” said the landowner
obviously rather proud of the word “rational.”

“My system’s very simple
management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes
the peasants come to me
are all one’s neighbors; one feels for them. So one advances them a
third
help me when I need it—whether it’s the sowing of the oats
haycutting
taxpayer—though there are dishonest ones among them too

Levin
exchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch
turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers.

“Then what do you think?” he asked; “what system is one to adopt
nowadays?”

“Why
or for rent to the peasants; that one can do—only that’s just how the
general prosperity of the country is being ruined. Where the land with
serf-labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one
half-crop system it yields three to one. Russia has been ruined by the
emancipation!”

Sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin
gesture of irony to him; but Levin did not think the landowner’s words
absurd
more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what
way Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very
true
spoke his own individual thought—a thing that very rarely happens—and a
thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some
exercise for an idle brain
conditions of his life
his village

“The point is
by the use of authority
without culture. “Take the reforms of Peter
Alexander. Take European history. And progress in agriculture more than
anything else—the potato
force. The wooden plough too wasn’t always used. It was introduced
maybe in the days before the Empire
force. Now
various improvements in our husbandry: drying machines and thrashing
machines
brought into use by our authority
first
have been deprived of our authority; and so our husbandry
been raised to a high level
primitive condition. That’s how I see it.”

“But why so? If it’s rational
system with hired labor

“We’ve no power over them. With whom am I going to work the system
allow me to ask?”

“There it is—the labor force—the chief element in agriculture
Levin.

“With laborers.”

“The laborers won’t work well
laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig
ruins everything you give him. He makes the horses ill with too much
water
drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine
loathes the sight of anything that’s not after his fashion. And that’s
how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen. Lands gone out of
cultivation
where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the
wealth of the country has decreased. If the same thing had been done
but with care that....”

And he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of
which these drawbacks might have been avoided.

This did not interest Levin
to his first position
him into expressing his serious opinion:—

“That the standard of culture is falling
relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a
rational system to yield a profit—that’s perfectly true

“I don’t believe it
that we don’t know how to cultivate the land
agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high
have no machines
even know how to keep accounts. Ask any landowner; he won’t be able to
tell you what crop’s profitable

“Italian bookkeeping
ironically. “You may keep your books as you like
everything for you

“Why do they spoil things? A poor thrashing machine
presser
wretched Russian nag they’ll ruin
ruin them. And so it is all round. We must raise our farming to a
higher level.”

“Oh
very well for you; but for me
lads to be educated at the high school—how am I going to buy these
dray-horses?”

“Well

“To get what’s left me sold by auction? No

“I don’t agree that it’s necessary or possible to raise the level of
agriculture still higher
have means
they’re any good. For my part
the way of husbandry
loss.”

“That’s true enough
positively laughing with satisfaction.

“And I’m not the only one
neighboring landowners
system; they all
tell us how does your land do—does it pay?” said Levin
Sviazhsky’s eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he
had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer
chambers of Sviazhsky’s mind.

Moreover
Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer
invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow
consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management
of their property
thousand odd roubles. She did not remember the precise sum
appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a
farthing.

The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of
Sviazhsky’s famling
marshal was likely to be making.

“Possibly it does not pay
either that I’m a bad manager
increase of my rents.”

“Oh
where land has been improved by the labor put into it
the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it—in other words
they’re working it out; so there’s no question of rent.”

“How no rent? It’s a law.”

“Then we’re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us
muddles us. No

“Will you have some junket? Masha
He turned to his wife. “Extraordinarily late the raspberries are
lasting this year.”

And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off
apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point
when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.

Having lost his antagonist
gray-whiskered landowner
difficulty arises from the fact that we don’t find out the
peculiarities and habits of our laborer; but the landowner
men who think independently and in isolation
other person’s idea
it that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness
to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority
none; one must have the stick
have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand
years by lawyers and model prisons
peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of
air.

“What makes you think
“that it’s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the
labor would become productive?”

“That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we’ve no power over
them

“How can new conditions be found?” said Sviazhsky. Having eaten some
junket and lighted a cigarette
possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied
he said. “The relic of barbarism
guarantee for all
abolished—there remains nothing but free labor
and ready made
rammers—you can’t get out of those forms.”

“But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.”

“Dissatisfied
probability.”

“That’s just what I was meaning
seek them for ourselves?”

“Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for
constructing railways. They are ready

“But if they don’t do for us

And again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.

“Oh
Europe was seeking for! I’ve heard all that; but
know all that’s been done in Europe on the question of the organization
of labor?”

“No

“That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe. The
Schulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of
the labor question
Mulhausen experiment? That’s a fact by now

“I have some idea of it

“No
I’m not a professor of sociology
really

“But what conclusion have they come to?”

“Excuse me....”

The two neighbors had risen
his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer
chambers of his mind


Chapter 28

Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he was
stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the
dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was
not an exceptional case
that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in
which they would work
Sviazhskys’
it seemed to him that the problem could be solved
try and solve it.

After saying good-night to the ladies
of the next day
see an interesting ruin in the crown forest
to bed
that Sviazhsky had offered him. Sviazhsky’s study was a huge room
surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it—one a massive
writing-table
round table
different languages
the writing-table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering
and full of papers of various sorts.

Sviazhsky took out the books

“What are you looking at there?” he said to Levin
the round table looking through the reviews.

“Oh
the review Levin was holding in his hand. “It appears
with eager interest
chiefly responsible for the partition of Poland. It is proved....”

And with his characteristic clearness
important
the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land
he heard Sviazhsky: “What is there inside of him? And why
interested in the partition of Poland?” When Sviazhsky had finished
Levin could not help asking: “Well
nothing to follow. It was simply interesting that it had been proved to
be so and so. But Sviazhsky did not explain
why it was interesting to him.

“Yes
Levin

“Oh
like all of them!” said Sviazhsky.

“Whose marshal you are.”

“Yes
laughing.

“I’ll tell you what interests me very much
that our system
that the only thing that answers is the money-lender system
meek-looking gentleman’s
it?”

“Our own
answers with Vassiltchikov.”

“A factory....”

“But I really don’t know what it is you are surprised at. The people
are at such a low stage of rational and moral development
obvious they’re bound to oppose everything that’s strange to them. In
Europe
follows that we must educate the people—that’s all.”

“But how are we to educate the people?”

“To educate the people three things are needed: schools
and schools.

“But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material
development: what help are schools for that?”

“Do you know
sick man—You should try purgative medicine. Taken: worse. Try leeches.
Tried them: worse. Well
Tried it: worse. That’s just how it is with us. I say political
economy; you say—worse. I say socialism: worse. Education: worse.”

“But how do schools help matters?”

“They give the peasant fresh wants.”

“Well
“In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their
material position? You say schools
wants. So much the worse
them. And in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the
catechism is going to improve their material condition
make out. The day before yesterday
evening with a little baby
she was going to the wise woman; her boy had screaming fits
taking him to be doctored. I asked
screaming fits?’ ‘She puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some
charm....’”

“Well
her child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming fits is just....”
Sviazhsky said

“Oh
meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools. The people are
poor and ignorant—that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the
baby is ill because it screams. But in what way this trouble of poverty
and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how
the hen-roost affects the screaming. What has to be cured is what makes
him poor.”

“Well
dislike so much. He says
greater prosperity and comfort
but not of being able to read and write....”

“Well
agreement with Spencer; only I’ve known it a long while. Schools can do
no good; what will do good is an economic organization in which the
people will become richer
be schools.”

“Still

“And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?” asked Levin.

But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky’s eyes
smiling:

“No; that screaming story is positively capital! Did you really hear it
yourself?”

Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man’s
life and his thoughts. Obviously he did not care in the least what his
reasoning led him to; all he wanted was the process of reasoning. And
he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a
blind alley. That was the only thing he disliked
changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.

All the impressions of the day
the old peasant
all the conceptions and ideas of the day
excitement. This dear good Sviazhsky
for social purposes
from Levin
public opinion by ideas he did not share; that irascible country
gentleman
worried into by life
class
the work he had been doing
all this—all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil
of some solution near at hand.

Left alone in the room assigned him
yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg
not fall asleep for a long while. Not one conversation with Sviazhsky
though he had said a great deal that was clever
but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.
Levin could not help recalling every word he had said
imagination amending his own replies.

“Yes
answer because the peasant hates improvements
forced on him by authority. If no system of husbandry answered at all
without these improvements
system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with
his habits
our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to
blame or the laborers. We have gone our way—the European way—a long
while
Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force
as the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts
system of culture in accordance with that. Imagine
said to him
you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the
success of the work
improvements which they will admit
the soil
in halves
be greater
one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in
its success. How to do this?—that’s a matter of detail; but undoubtedly
it can be done.”

This idea threw Levin into a great excitement. He did not sleep half
the night
practice. He had not intended to go away next day
determined to go home early in the morning. Besides
with her low-necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and
remorse for some utterly base action. Most important of all—he must get
back without delay: he would have to make haste to put his new project
to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat
sowing might be undertaken on a new basis. He had made up his mind to
revolutionize his whole system.


Chapter 29

The carrying out of Levin’s plan presented many difficulties; but he
struggled on
what he desired
believe that the attempt was worth the trouble. One of the chief
difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full
swing
from the beginning

When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his
plans
long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time
was stupid and useless. The bailiff said that he had said so a long
while ago
by Levin—to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each
agricultural undertaking—at this the bailiff simply expressed a
profound despondency
immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining
sheaves of rye the next day
ploughing
it.

On beginning to talk to the peasants about it
to cede them the land on new terms
same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current
work of the day
disadvantages of the proposed scheme.

The simple-hearted Ivan
Levin’s proposal—that he should with his family take a share of the
profits of the cattle-yard—and he was in complete sympathy with the
plan. But when Levin hinted at the future advantages
expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say
and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no
delay: he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens
or ran to get water or to clear out the dung.

Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that
a landowner’s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze
all he could out of them. They were firmly convinced that his real aim
(whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say
to them. And they themselves
deal but never said what was their real object. Moreover (Levin felt
that the irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their
first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they
should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind
use new implements. They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better
that the scarifier did the work more quickly
of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of
them; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to
lower the standard of cultivation

these difficulties he got his way
working

At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land
just as it was to the peasants

impossible

but these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new
organization of the whole

It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before
and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made
of fresh cream
that butter is more profitable made from sour cream
wages just as under the old system
in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out
of his future share in the profits.

It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov’s company did not plough over the
ground twice before sowing
on the plea that the time was too short. It is true that the peasants

till the winter.

It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens
he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants. He evidently quite
misunderstood
conditions upon which the land had been given to him.

Often

talked to the cleverest of the peasants

These matters
his hands
whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting. At the end of
August he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow
servant who brought back the side-saddle. He felt that in not answering
Darya Alexandrovna’s letter he had by his rudeness
not think without a flush of shame
never go and see them again. He had been just as rude with the
Sviazhskys
to see them again either. He did not care about that now. The business
of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as
though there would never be anything else in his life. He read the
books lent him by Sviazhsky
read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject
had anticipated
In the books on political economy—in Mill
studied first with great ardor
to the questions that were engrossing him—he found laws deduced from
the condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these
laws
same thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but
impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student
or they were attempts at improving
which Europe was placed
had nothing in common. Political economy told him that the laws by
which the wealth of Europe had been developed
universal and unvarying. Socialism told him that development along
these lines leads to ruin. And neither of them gave an answer
a hint
peasants and landowners

Having once taken the subject up
bearing on it
systems on the spot
confronted with what so often met him on various subjects. Often
as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was
talking to
told: “But Kauffmann
read them: they’ve thrashed that question out thoroughly.”

He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell
him. He knew what he wanted. He saw that Russia has splendid land
splendid laborers

is great—in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the
European way the produce is small
fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own
peculiar way
invariable
the Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast
tracts of unoccupied land
occupied
methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed. And he
wanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his
land.


Chapter 30

At the end of September the timber had been carted for building the
cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of
peasants
divided. In practice the system worked capitally
seemed to Levin. In order to work out the whole subject theoretically
and to complete his book
to effect a revolution in political economy
science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the
relation of the people to the soil
a tour abroad
same direction
been done there was not what was wanted. Levin was only waiting for the
delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad. But
the rains began
left in the fields
delivery of the wheat.

The mud was impassable along the roads; two mills were carried away
and the weather got worse and worse.

On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning
for fine weather
journey. He gave orders for the wheat to be delivered
to the merchant to get the money owing him
give some final directions on the estate before setting off.

Having finished all his business
water which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his
gaiters
homewards in the evening. The weather had become worse than ever
towards evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she
went along sideways
under his hood
running under the wheels
the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the
bridge
heaped up about the stripped elm-tree. In spite of the gloominess of
nature around him
having with the peasants in the further village had shown that they
were beginning to get used to their new position. The old servant to
whose hut he had gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin’s plan
and of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase
of cattle.

“I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim
end
This is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public
welfare comes into it. The whole system of culture

Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness.

The bailiff
part of the money for the wheat. An agreement had been made with the
old servant
the corn was still standing in the fields
sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with
the losses of others.

After dinner Levin was sitting
with a book
him in connection with his book. Today all the significance of his book
rose before him with special distinctness
themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories. “I must write
that down
I thought unnecessary before.” He got up to go to his writing-table
and Laska
as though to inquire where to go. But he had not time to write it down
for the head peasants had come round
to them.

After his levee
the next day
Levin went back to his study and sat down to work.

Laska lay under the table; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her
place with her stocking.

After writing for a little while
exceptional vividness of Kitty
got up and began walking about the room.

“What’s the use of being dreary?” said Agafea Mihalovna. “Come
you stay on at home? You ought to go to some warm springs
now you’re ready for the journey.”

“Well
finish my work.”

“There
peasants! Why
some honor from the Tsar for it.’ Indeed and it is a strange thing; why
need you worry about the peasants?”

“I’m not worrying about them; I’m doing it for my own good.”

Agafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin’s plans for his land. Levin
often put his views before her in all their complexity
uncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments. But
on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said.

“Of one’s soul’s salvation we all know and must think before all else
she said with a sigh. “Parfen Denisitch now
he died a death that God grant everyone of us the like
referring to a servant who had died recently. “Took the sacrament and
all.”

“That’s not what I mean
advantage. It’s all the better for me if the peasants do their work
better.”

“Well
be at sixes and sevens. If he has a conscience
there’s no doing anything.”

“Oh
better.”

“All I say is
random
that’s what I say.”

Agafea Mihalovna’s allusion to the very subject he had only just been
thinking about
answering her
that he had been thinking of the real significance of that work. Only
at intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea
Mihalovna’s needles
he frowned again.

At nine o’clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a
carriage over the mud.

“Well
Mihalovna
His work was not going well now
it might be.


Chapter 31

Running halfway down the staircase
familiar cough in the hall. But he heard it indistinctly through the
sound of his own footsteps
sight of a long
possibility of mistake; and yet he still went on hoping that this tall
man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother Nikolay.

Levin loved his brother
now
him
humor
particularly difficult. Instead of a lively
outsider who would
had to see his brother
call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart
himself fully. And that he was not disposed to do.

Angry with himself for so base a feeling
soon as he had seen his brother close
disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity. Terrible as
his brother Nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness
now he looked still more emaciated
skeleton covered with skin.

He stood in the hall
off it
submissive and humble

“You see
one second taking his eyes off his brother’s face. “I’ve been meaning
to a long while
much better

“Yes
kissing him
and saw close to him his big eyes

A few weeks before
through the sale of the small part of the property
undivided
as his share.

Nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and
important
earth
that lay before him. In spite of his exaggerated stoop
emaciation that was so striking from his height
rapid and abrupt as ever. Levin led him into his study.

His brother dressed with particular care—a thing he never used to
do—combed his scanty

He was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood
often remembered him in childhood. He even referred to Sergey
Ivanovitch without rancor. When he saw Agafea Mihalovna
with her and asked after the old servants. The news of the death of
Parfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him. A look of fear
crossed his face

“Of course he was quite old
I’ll spend a month or two with you
know
service. Now I’m going to arrange my life quite differently
on. “You know I got rid of that woman.”

“Marya Nikolaevna? Why

“Oh
he did not say what the annoyances were. He could not say that he had
cast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak
because she would look after him

“Besides
silly things
consideration; I don’t regret it. So long as there’s health
health

Levin listened and racked his brains
say. Nikolay probably felt the same; he began questioning his brother
about his affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself
then he could speak without hypocrisy. He told his brother of his plans
and his doings.

His brother listened

These two men were so akin
gesture

Both of them now had only one thought—the illness of Nikolay and the
nearness of his death—which stifled all else. But neither of them dared
to speak of it
that filled their minds—was all falsehood. Never had Levin been so glad
when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed. Never with any
outside person
and false as he was that evening. And the consciousness of this
unnaturalness
unnatural. He wanted to weep over his dying
he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live.

As the house was damp
put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen.

His brother got into bed
about like a sick man
clear
said
“Ah
His thoughts were of the most various
was the same—death. Death
time presented itself to him with irresistible force. And death
was here in this loved brother
calling without distinction on God and the devil
it had hitherto seemed to him. It was in himself too
not today
the same! And what was this inevitable death—he did not know
thought about it
courage to think about it.

“I work
had forgotten—death.”

He sat on his bed in the darkness
holding his breath from the strain of thought
more intensely he thought
indubitably so
one little fact—that death will come
even worth beginning
was awful

“But I am alive still. Now what’s to be done? what’s to be done?” he
said in despair. He lighted a candle
looking-glass
gray hairs about his temples. He opened his mouth. His back teeth were
beginning to decay. He bared his muscular arms. Yes
in them. But Nikolay
lungs
they used to go to bed together as children
till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each
other and laugh
Bogdanitch could not check the effervescing
and happiness. “And now that bent
what will become of me

“K...ha! K...ha! Damnation! Why do you keep fidgeting
to sleep?” his brother’s voice called to him.

“Oh

“I have had a good sleep
shirt; it’s not wet

Levin felt
a long while he could not sleep. The question how to live had hardly
begun to grow a little clearer to him
presented itself—death.

“Why
can I say to him? What do I know about it? I’d even forgotten that it
was at all.”


Chapter 32

Levin had long before made the observation that when one is
uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and
meek
touchiness and irritability. He felt that this was how it would be with
his brother. And his brother Nikolay’s gentleness did in fact not last
out for long. The very next morning he began to be irritable
seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother
his tenderest points.

Levin felt himself to blame
that if they had both not kept up appearances
called
were thinking and feeling—they would simply have looked into each
other’s faces
you’re dying!” and Nikolay could only have answered
but I’m afraid
nothing more
like that was impossible
been trying to do all his life
far as he could observe
without it there was no living at all. He tried to say what he was not
thinking
his brother detected him in it

The third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him
again
it with communism.

“You’ve simply borrowed an idea that’s not your own
distorted it

“But I tell you it’s nothing to do with it. They deny the justice of
property
stimulus.” (Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions
ever since he had been engrossed by his work
more and more frequently to use words not Russian.) “All I want is to
regulate labor.”

“Which means
its force
Nikolay

“But my idea has nothing in common....”

“That
flashing malignantly
it?—geometrical symmetry
Utopia. But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the
past a _tabula rasa_—no property
itself. But you gain nothing....”

“Why do you mix things up? I’ve never been a communist.”

“But I have
future

“All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated
from the point of view of natural science; that is to say
be studied

“But that’s utter waste of time. That force finds a certain form of
activity of itself
have been slaves first everywhere
half-crop system

Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words
his heart he was afraid that it was true—true that he was trying to
hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms
that this was hardly possible.

“I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for
the laborers. I want to organize....” he answered hotly.

“You don’t want to organize anything; it’s simply just as you’ve been
all your life
the peasants simply

“Oh
Levin

“You’ve never had
please your vanity.”

“Oh

“And I will let you alone! and it’s high time I did
devil with you! and I’m very sorry I ever came!”

In spite of all Levin’s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards
Nikolay would listen to nothing he said
to part
to him.

Nikolay was just getting ready to go
again and begged him
his feelings in any way.

“Ah
right
going all the same.”

It was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him
with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother:

“Anyway
quivered. These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely
between them. Levin knew that those words meant
know
again.” Levin knew this
his brother once more
say.

Three days after his brother’s departure
foreign tour. Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky
railway train

“What’s the matter with you?” Shtcherbatsky asked him.

“Oh

“Not much? You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen. You shall
see how to be happy.”

“No

“Well
just getting ready to begin.”

“Yes
dead.”

Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late. He saw nothing
but death or the advance towards death in everything. But his cherished
scheme only engrossed him the more. Life had to be got through somehow
till death did come. Darkness had fallen upon everything for him; but
just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the
darkness was his work
strength.






PART FOUR


Chapter 1

The Karenins
every day
Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day
servants might have no grounds for suppositions
home. Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s house
him away from home

The position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would
have been equal to enduring this position for a single day
not been for the expectation that it would change
temporary painful ordeal which would pass over. Alexey Alexandrovitch
hoped that this passion would pass
everyone would forget about it
Anna
than for anyone
believed
had not the least idea what would settle the position
believed that something would very soon turn up now. Vronsky
his own will or wishes
apart from his own action

In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week. A
foreign prince
his charge
of distinguished appearance; he possessed
behaving with respectful dignity
such grand personages—that was how he came to be put in charge of the
prince. But he felt his duties very irksome. The prince was anxious to
miss nothing of which he would be asked at home
Russia? And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost
all Russian forms of amusement. Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in
satisfying both these inclinations. The mornings they spent driving to
look at places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the
national entertainments. The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even
among princes. By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had
brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure
he looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber. The prince had
traveled a great deal
modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the
pleasures of all nations.

He had been in Spain
friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin. In Switzerland he
had killed chamois. In England he had galloped in a red coat over
hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet. In Turkey he had got
into a harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant
he wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.

Vronsky
was at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by
various persons to the prince. They had race horses
pancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges
drinking feasts
the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit
smashed trays full of crockery
seemed to be asking—what more
consist in just this?

In reality
French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne. Vronsky
was used to princes
late
seemed fearfully wearisome to him. The whole of that week he
experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a
dangerous madman
being with him
conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of
stern official respectfulness
The prince’s manner of treating the very people who
surprise
Russian amusements
whom he wished to study
indignation. The chief reason why the prince was so particularly
disagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in
him. And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self-esteem. He
was a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very
well-washed man
and Vronsky could not deny it. He was equable and not cringing with his
superiors
and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors. Vronsky was
himself the same
this prince he was an inferior
attitude to him revolted him.

“Brainless beef! can I be like that?” he thought.

Be that as it might
prince
happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant
reflection of himself. He said good-bye to him at the station on their
return from a bear hunt
prowess kept up all night.


Chapter 2

When he got home
am ill and unhappy. I cannot come out
without seeing you. Come in this evening. Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to
the council at seven and will be there till ten.” Thinking for an
instant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her
spite of her husband’s insisting on her not receiving him
to go.

Vronsky had that winter got his promotion
the regimental quarters
he lay down on the sofa immediately
the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were
confused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the
peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt
fell asleep. He waked up in the dark
haste to light a candle. “What was it? What? What was the dreadful
thing I dreamed? Yes
beard was stooping down doing something
saying some strange words in French. Yes
dream
recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the
peasant had uttered

“What nonsense!” thought Vronsky

It was half-past eight already. He rang up his servant
haste
only worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins’ entrance he
looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine. A high
carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance. He
recognized Anna’s carriage. “She is coming to me
“and better she should. I don’t like going into that house. But no
matter; I can’t hide myself
to him from childhood
Vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door. The door opened
and the hall-porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage. Vronsky
though he did not usually notice details
amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him. In the very
doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch. The gas
jet threw its full light on the bloodless
hat and on the white cravat
Karenin’s fixed
bowed
his hat and went on. Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the
carriage
disappear. Vronsky went into the hall. His brows were scowling
eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them.

“What a position!” he thought. “If he would fight
his honor
baseness.... He puts me in the position of playing false
meant and never mean to do.”

Vronsky’s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with Anna
in the Vrede garden. Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna—who
had surrendered herself up to him utterly
decide her fate
think that their tie might end as he had thought then. His ambitious
plans had retreated into the background again
got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite
had given himself entirely to his passion
him more and more closely to her.

He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating
footsteps. He knew she had been expecting him
and was now going back to the drawing-room.

“No
tears came into her eyes. “No; if things are to go on like this
end will come much

“What is it

“What? I’ve been waiting in agony for an hour
won’t ... I can’t quarrel with you. Of course you couldn’t come. No
won’t.” She laid her two hands on his shoulders
while at him with a profound
searching look. She was studying his face to make up for the time she
had not seen him. She was
of him in her imagination (incomparably superior
reality) fit with him as he really was.


Chapter 3

“You met him?” she asked
lamplight. “You’re punished

“Yes; but how was it? Wasn’t he to be at the council?”

“He had been and come back
that’s no matter. Don’t talk about it. Where have you been? With the
prince still?”

She knew every detail of his existence. He was going to say that he had
been up all night and had dropped asleep
and rapturous face
report on the prince’s departure.

“But it’s over now? He is gone?”

“Thank God it’s over! You wouldn’t believe how insufferable it’s been
for me.”

“Why so? Isn’t it the life all of you
said
on the table
Vronsky.

“I gave that life up long ago
face
a smile
were
it.”

She held the work in her hands
with strange

“This morning Liza came to see me—they’re not afraid to call on me
spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna
about your Athenian evening. How loathsome!”

“I was just going to say....”

She interrupted him. “It was that Thérèse you used to know?”

“I was just saying....”

“How disgusting you are
woman can never forget that
and so letting him see the cause of her irritation
who cannot know your life? What do I know? What have I ever known?” she
said
truth?...”

“Anna
haven’t a thought I wouldn’t lay bare to you?”

“Yes
thoughts. “But if only you knew how wretched I am! I believe you
believe you.... What were you saying?”

But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say. These
fits of jealousy
her
made him feel cold to her
was her love for him. How often he had told himself that her love was
happiness; and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has
outweighed for her all the good things of life—and he was much further
from happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow. Then he had
thought himself unhappy
the best happiness was already left behind. She was utterly unlike what
she had been when he first saw her. Both morally and physically she had
changed for the worse. She had broadened out all over
at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil
expression of hatred that distorted it. He looked at her as a man looks
at a faded flower he has gathered
the beauty for which he picked and ruined it. And in spite of this he
felt that then
wished it
that moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her
bound him to her could not be broken.

“Well
driven away the fiend
given her jealousy. “What did you begin to tell me about the prince?
Why did you find it so tiresome?”

“Oh
interrupted thought. “He does not improve on closer acquaintance. If
you want him defined
medals at the cattle shows
vexation that interested her.

“No; how so?” she replied. “He’s seen a great deal
cultured?”

“It’s an utterly different culture—their culture. He’s cultivated
sees
but animal pleasures.”

“But don’t you all care for these animal pleasures?” she said
again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him.

“How is it you’re defending him?” he said

“I’m not defending him
not cared for those pleasures yourself
But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Thérèse in the attire of
Eve....”

“Again
the table and kissing it.

“Yes; but I can’t help it. You don’t know what I have suffered waiting
for you. I believe I’m not jealous. I’m not jealous: I believe you when
you’re here; but when you’re away somewhere leading your life
incomprehensible to me....”

She turned away from him
work
after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight
the slender wrist moved swiftly

“How was it
sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone.

“We ran up against each other in the doorway.”

“And he bowed to you like this?”

She drew a long face
her expression
beautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had
bowed to him. He smiled
laugh

“I don’t understand him in the least
avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you
called me out—but this I can’t understand. How can he put up with such
a position? He feels it

“He?” she said sneeringly. “He’s perfectly satisfied.”

“What are we all miserable for

“Only not he. Don’t I know him
steeped?... Could one
He understands nothing
live in the same house with his unfaithful wife? Could he talk to her
call her ‘my dear’?”

And again she could not help mimicking him: “‘Anna
dear’!”

“He’s not a man
know him. Oh
torn to pieces a wife like me. I wouldn’t have said
chère_’! He’s not a man
understand that I’m your wife
superfluous.... Don’t let’s talk of him!...”

“You’re unfair
her. “But never mind
doing? What is the matter? What has been wrong with you
the doctor say?”

She looked at him with mocking amusement. Evidently she had hit on
other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the
moment to give expression to them.

But he went on:

“I imagine that it’s not illness

The ironical light died away in her eyes
consciousness of something
melancholy

“Soon
an end to it. If you knew how terrible it is to me
to be able to love you freely and boldly! I should not torture myself
and torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon
we expect.”

And at the thought of how it would come
herself that tears came into her eyes
laid her hand on his sleeve
lamplight.

“It won’t come as we suppose. I didn’t mean to say this to you
you’ve made me. Soon
at peace

“I don’t understand

“You asked when? Soon. And I shan’t live through it. Don’t interrupt
me!” and she made haste to speak. “I know it; I know for certain. I
shall die; and I’m very glad I shall die

Tears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and began
kissing it
grounds

“Yes
only way

He had recovered himself

“How absurd! What absurd nonsense you are talking!”

“No

“What

“That I shall die. I have had a dream.”

“A dream?” repeated Vronsky
his dream.

“Yes
dreamed that I ran into my bedroom
to find out something; you know how it is in dreams
eyes wide with horror; “and in the bedroom
something.”

“Oh

But she would not let him interrupt her. What she was saying was too
important to her.

“And the something turned round
disheveled beard
but he bent down over a sack
hands....”

She showed how he had moved his hands. There was terror in her face.
And Vronsky
soul.

“He was fumbling and kept talking quickly
_Il faut le battre
I tried to wake up
began asking myself what it meant. And Korney said to me: ‘In
childbirth you’ll die

“What nonsense
there was no conviction in his voice.

“But don’t let’s talk of it. Ring the bell
little now; it’s not long I shall....”

But all at once she stopped. The expression of her face instantaneously
changed. Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of
soft
of the change. She was listening to the stirring of the new life within
her.

“I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her
lover.”

“I meant
angered her
for you to insult me?” she said.

“An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted
he’s a thief is simply _la constatation d’un fait_.”

“This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.”

“You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty
the honorable protection of his name
observing the proprieties: is that cruelty?”

“It’s worse than cruel—it’s base
a rush of hatred

“No!” he shrieked
than usual even
violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing
he forcibly sat her down in her place.

“Base! If you care to use that word
and child for a lover

She bowed her head. She did not say what she had said the evening
before to her lover
superfluous; she did not even think that. She felt all the justice of
his words

“You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself;
but what are you saying all this for?”

“What am I saying it for? what for?” he went on
may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to
observing outward decorum
state of things.”

“Soon
thought of death near at hand and now desired
eyes.

“It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned! If you must
have the satisfaction of animal passion....”

“Alexey Alexandrovitch! I won’t say it’s not generous
like a gentleman to strike anyone who’s down.”

“Yes
your husband have no interest for you. You don’t care that his whole
life is ruined

Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered
was utterly unable to articulate the word “suffering.” In the end he
pronounced it “thuffering.” She wanted to laugh
ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment. And for the
first time
and was sorry for him. But what could she say or do? Her head sank
she sat silent. He too was silent for some time
speaking in a frigid
had no special significance.

“I came to tell you....” he said.

She glanced at him. “No
expression of his face when he stumbled over the word “suffering.” “No;
can a man with those dull eyes
feel anything?”

“I cannot change anything

“I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow

getting a divorce. My son is going to my sister’s

“Yes

him. Good-bye!”

And he was going away

“Alexey Alexandrovitch

confined; leave him!”

Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage

The waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when
Alexey Alexandrovitch entered it. Three ladies—an old lady
lady
with a ring on his finger
third a wrathful-looking government clerk in official uniform
cross on his neck—had obviously been waiting a long while already. Two
clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens. The appurtenances
of the writing-tables
very fastidious
this. One of the clerks
Alexey Alexandrovitch

He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business.

“He is engaged
pen at the persons waiting

“Can’t he spare time to see me?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.

“He has no time free; he is always busy. Kindly wait your turn.”

“Then I must trouble you to give him my card
said with dignity
incognito.

The clerk took the card and
it

Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of
legal proceedings
disliked the application of the principle in Russia
it
of the Emperor. His whole life had been spent in administrative work
and consequently
was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and
the possibility of reform in every department. In the new public law
courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting
cases. But till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts
so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his
disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on
him in the lawyer’s waiting room.

“Coming immediately
actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who
had been consulting with the lawyer himself.

The lawyer was a little
light-colored long eyebrows
though for a wedding
varnished boots. His face was clever and manly
dandified and in bad taste.

“Pray walk in
gloomily ushering Karenin in before him

“Won’t you sit down?” He indicated an armchair at a writing-table
covered with papers. He sat down himself
with short fingers covered with white hairs
side. But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over
the table. The lawyer
expected of him
former attitude.

“Before beginning to speak of my business
following the lawyer’s movements with wondering eyes
observe that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be
strictly private.”

The lawyer’s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely
perceptible smile.

“I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to
me. But if you would like proof....”

Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face
gray eyes were laughing

“You know my name?” Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.

“I know you and the good”—again he caught a moth—“work you are doing
like every Russian

Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed
made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice
hesitation

“I have the misfortune
deceived in my married life
with my wife by legal means—that is
that my son may not remain with his mother.”

The lawyer’s gray eyes tried not to laugh
irrepressible glee
simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there
was triumph and joy
in his wife’s eyes.

“You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?”

“Yes
time and attention. I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary
step. I want a divorce
great consequence to me. It is very possible that if that form does not
correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.”

“Oh
you to decide.”

He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s feet
might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement. He
looked at a moth that flew before his nose
did not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch’s position.

“Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to
me
of the forms in which such things are done in practice.”

“You would be glad
adopting
remarks
secure what you desire?”

And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch
on
which was growing red in patches.

“Divorce by our laws

have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application
in practice. And therefore
that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the
following—there’s no physical defect

Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.

“—May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married

“People cannot go on living together—here you have a fact. And if both

method.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now. But he had religious
scruples

“That is out of the question in the present case
alternative is possible: undesigned detection
which I have.”

At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips
utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.

“Kindly consider
under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of
going into the minutest details in cases of that kind
smile
“Letters may

“If it is so....” Alexey Alexandrovitch began
but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak
to the intruding clerk.

“Tell her we don’t haggle over fees!” he said
Alexandrovitch.

On his way back he caught unobserved another moth. “Nice state my rep
curtains will be in by the summer!” he thought

“And so you were saying?...” he said.

“I will communicate my decision to you by letter
Alexandrovitch
standing a moment in silence
consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained? I would ask you
to let me know what are your terms.”

“It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action

information from you?” he asked
his varnished boots shining.

“In a week’s time. Your answer as to whether you will undertake to
conduct the case
communicate to me.”

“Very good.”

The lawyer bowed respectfully
left alone
mirthful that
to the haggling lady
next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet

Chapter 6

Alexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of
the Commission of the 17th of August
cut the ground from under his feet. The new commission for the inquiry
into the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been
formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and
energy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch. Within three months a report
was presented. The condition of the native tribes was investigated in
its political
religious aspects. To all these questions there were answers admirably
stated
product of human thought
product of official activity. The answers were all based on official
data furnished by governors and heads of churches
reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents
founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish
priests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain. All
such questions as
the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs
etc.—questions which

consequence of this
was chaos
whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined

lavished on him for his wife’s infidelity
in this position he took an important resolution. To the astonishment

Alexey Alexandrovitch’s departure made a great sensation
as just before he started he officially returned the posting-fares
allowed him for twelve horses

“I think it very noble
“Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are
railways everywhere now?”

But Princess Myakaya did not agree

“It’s all very well for you to talk

revising tour in the summer. It’s very good for him and pleasant
traveling about

On his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for
three days at Moscow.

The day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the
governor-general. At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place
always crowds of carriages and sledges
heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he
could not help looking round. At the corner of the pavement
short
askew
stood Stepan Arkadyevitch
vigorously and urgently
on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner
the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat
children. Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his
brother-in-law. The lady smiled a kindly smile too
her hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch. It was Dolly with her children.

Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow
of all his wife’s brother. He raised his hat and would have driven on
but Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop
snow to him.

“Well
Dussots’ yesterday and saw ‘Karenin’ on the visitors’ list
never entered my head that it was you
sticking his head in at the window of the carriage
looked you up. I am glad to see you!” he said
against the other to shake the snow off. “What a shame of you not to
let us know!” he repeated.

“I had no time; I am very busy

“Come to my wife

Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were
wrapped
Darya Alexandrovna.

“Why
said Dolly

“I was very busy. Delighted to see you!” he said in a tone clearly
indicating that he was annoyed by it. “How are you?”

“Tell me

Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on. But
Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.

“I tell you what we’ll do tomorrow. Dolly
Koznishev and Pestsov

“Yes
o’clock

“She is quite well
“Delighted!” and he moved away towards his carriage.

“You will come?” Dolly called after him.

Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the
noise of the moving carriages.

“I shall come round tomorrow!” Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him.

Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage
so as neither to see nor be seen.

“Queer fish!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife

“Stiva! Stiva!” Dolly called

Chapter 7

The next day was Sunday. Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater
to a rehearsal of the ballet
dancing-girl whom he had just taken under his protection
necklace he had promised her the evening before
in the dim daylight of the theater
face
wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet. After
explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet
promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper. From
the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row
the fish and asparagus for dinner
Dussots’
same hotel: Levin
staying there; the new head of his department
promoted to that position
Moscow; and his brother-in-law
sure of bringing him to dinner.

Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining
dinner
as regards the selection of guests. He particularly liked the program
of that day’s dinner. There would be fresh perch

to suit: so much for the eating and drinking. Kitty and Levin would be

Alexandrovitch. Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man
Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger
was asking
liberal
delightfully youthful person of fifty
for Koznishev and Karenin. He would provoke them and set them off.

The second installment for the forest had been received from the
merchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and
good-humored of late
Arkadyevitch from every point of view. He was in the most light-hearted
mood. There were two circumstances a little unpleasant
circumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which
flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch. These two circumstances were:
first
street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him
putting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face and the fact
that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with
the rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky
guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.

That was one disagreeable thing. The other slightly disagreeable fact
was that the new head of his department
reputation already of a terrible person
the morning
working in the same way. Moreover
reputation of being a bear in his manners
reports
his predecessor had belonged
hitherto belonged himself. On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had
appeared at the office in a uniform
affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance. Consequently
Stepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his
non-official dress. The thought that the new chief might not tender him
a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing. But Stepan
Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would _come round_ all
right. “They’re all people
and quarrelsome?” he thought as he went into the hotel.

“Good-day
cocked on one side
your whiskers grow! Levin
find out whether Count Anitchkin” (this was the new head) “is
receiving.”

“Yes
a long while.”

“I was here yesterday
seven?”

Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room
measuring a fresh bearskin

“What! you killed him?” cried Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Well done! A
she-bear? How are you

He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair
without taking off his coat and hat.

“Come
hat.

“No
Stepan Arkadyevitch. He threw open his coat
off
the most intimate subjects.

“Come
Stepan Arkadyevitch

“Oh
the capitals
was new to me. And I’m glad I went.”

“Yes

“Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question. In Russia the
question is that of the relation of the working people to the land;
though the question exists there too—but there it’s a matter of
repairing what’s been ruined

Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.

“Yes
you’re in good spirits
interested. Shtcherbatsky told me another story—he met you—that you
were in such a depressed state

“Well
“It’s true that it’s high time I was dead; and that all this is
nonsense. It’s the truth I’m telling you. I do value my idea and my
work awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours
is nothing but a speck of mildew
And for us to suppose we can have something great—ideas
dust and ashes.”

“But all that’s as old as the hills

“It is old; but do you know
everything becomes of no consequence. When you understand that you will
die tomorrow
is so unimportant! And I consider my idea very important
out really to be as unimportant too
doing for that bear. So one goes on living
hunting

Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened
to Levin.

“Well
you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life? Don’t be so severe
moralist!”

“No; all the same
don’t know. All I know is that we shall soon be dead.”

“Why so soon?”

“And do you know
but there’s more peace.”

“On the contrary
said Stepan Arkadyevitch

“Oh
each other again? I’m going tomorrow.”

“I’m a nice person! Why
come to dinner with us today. Your brother’s coming
brother-in-law.”

“You don’t mean to say he’s here?” said Levin
about Kitty. He had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was
at Petersburg with her sister
know whether she had come back or not; but he changed his mind and did
not ask. “Whether she’s coming or not
himself.

“So you’ll come?”

“Of course.”

“At five o’clock

And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of
his department. Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch. The
terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person
Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on
o’clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch.


Chapter 8

Alexey Alexandrovitch
the whole morning indoors. He had two pieces of business before him
that morning; first
native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg
secondly
though it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s instigation
not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect

the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play.
They naïvely believed that it was their business to lay before the
commission their needs and the actual condition of things

He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer
of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s voice. Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with
Alexey Alexandrovitch’s servant

“No matter

why it is I can’t dine with him.”

“Come in!” he said aloud
the blotting-paper.

“There
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s voice
let him in
the room. “Well
Arkadyevitch began cheerfully.

“I cannot come
asking his visitor to sit down.

Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid
relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against
whom he was beginning a suit for divorce. But he had not taken into
account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan
Arkadyevitch.

Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear

“Why can’t you? What do you mean?” he asked in perplexity
French. “Oh

“I want to tell you that I can’t dine at your house
of relationship which have existed between us must cease.”

“How? How do you mean? What for?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a
smile.

“Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister
wife. I ought to have....”

But
Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected. He
groaned and sank into an armchair.

“No
his suffering was apparent in his face.

“It is so.”

“Excuse me

Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down

his relations with his brother-in-law would remain unchanged.

“Yes

“I will say one thing

“Oh

“Pardon

not act in haste!”

“I am not acting in haste
cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter. I have quite made up my
mind.”

“This is awful!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I would do one thing

I beseech you!”

Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered
sympathetically

“You will go to see her?”

“I don’t know. That was just why I have not been to see you. I imagine
our relations must change.”

“Why so? I don’t see that. Allow me to believe that apart from our
connection you have for me
I have always had for you ... and sincere esteem

And
interested them both—the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s department
a man not yet old

Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count
Anitchkin
from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials—that hatred felt by
one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a
promotion

“Well

“Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday. He seems to know his work

“Yes
“Is he aiming at doing anything
It’s the great misfortune of our government—this paper administration

“Really

Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch.

“Why
Dolgovushin’s! So please come round to dinner. You can’t imagine how
you will grieve my wife and me.”

The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother-in-law out was
very different from the manner in which he had met him.

“I’ve promised

intellectuals

were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject
not because they belonged to opposite parties
they were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any
distinction between their views); but
special shade of opinion. And since no difference is less easily
overcome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions
they never agreed in any opinion

They were just going in at the door

Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up
that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he
were a sturgeon. Kitty was looking at the door
energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin.
Young Shtcherbatsky
to look as though he were not in the least conscious of it. Karenin
himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies
and was wearing evening dress and a white tie. Stepan Arkadyevitch saw
by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise
performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering. He
was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all
the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in.

On entering the drawing-room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized
that he had been detained by that prince
for all his absences and unpunctualities
all the guests acquainted with each other
Alexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev
discussion of the Russification of Poland
plunged with Pestsov. Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder
something comic in his ear
prince. Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening
and presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin. In a moment he had so kneaded
together the social dough that the drawing-room became very lively
there was a merry buzz of voices. Konstantin Levin was the only person
who had not arrived. But this was so much the better
dining-room
sherry had been procured from Depré
that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy’s
he was going back to the drawing-room.

In the dining-room he was met by Konstantin Levin.

“I’m not late?”

“You can never help being late!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
arm.

“Have you a lot of people? Who’s here?” asked Levin
blushing

“All our own set. Kitty’s here. Come along
Karenin.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch
meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction
treated his best friends to this honor. But at that instant Konstantin
Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making
such an acquaintance. He had not seen Kitty since that memorable
evening when he met Vronsky
had had a glimpse of her on the highroad. He had known at the bottom of
his heart that he would see her here today. But to keep his thoughts
free
when he heard that she was here
delight
and he could not utter what he wanted to say.

“What is she like
what she was in the carriage? What if Darya Alexandrovna told the
truth? Why shouldn’t it be the truth?” he thought.

“Oh
and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing-room
and beheld her.

She was not the same as she used to be
the carriage; she was quite different.

She was scared
saw him the very instant he walked into the room. She had been
expecting him. She was delighted
that there was a moment
glanced again at her
thought she would break down and would begin to cry. She crimsoned
turned white
lips for him to come to her. He went up to her
hand without speaking. Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the
moisture in her eyes that made them brighter
as she said:

“How long it is since we’ve seen each other!” and with desperate
determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.

“You’ve not seen me
smile of happiness. “I saw you when you were driving from the railway
station to Ergushovo.”

“When?” she asked

“You were driving to Ergushovo
with the rapture that was flooding his heart. “And how dared I
associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching
creature? And
me

Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin.

“Let me introduce you.” He mentioned their names.

“Very glad to meet you again
shaking hands with Levin.

“You are acquainted?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.

“We spent three hours together in the train
got out

“Nonsense! Come along
the direction of the dining-room.

The men went into the dining-room and went up to a table
sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese
spades and some without
and plates with slices of French bread.

The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies
and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev
Karenin

Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most
heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that
changed the disposition of his opponent. He did this now.

Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of
Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which
ought to be introduced by the Russian government.

Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is
the more densely populated.

Koznishev admitted both points
going out of the drawing-room to conclude the argument
smiling:

“So
but one method—to bring up as many children as one can. My brother and
I are terribly in fault
Arkadyevitch
said
to him.

Everyone laughed

“Oh
the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit. The conversation dropped
at the jest.

“This cheese is not bad. Shall I give you some?” said the master of the
house. “Why

“What biceps! A perfect Samson!”

“I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears
Alexandrovitch
off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.

Levin smiled.

“Not at all. Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear
with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies
table.

“You have killed a bear
assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip
away
bears on your place?” she added
him and smiling.

There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said
unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound
her lips
forgiveness
tenderness—and promise and hope and love for him
but believe in and which choked him with happiness.

“No
there that I met your _beau-frère_ in the train

And he began telling with droll good-humor how

ear for his brother
with him today? Why such a conquering hero?” he thought. He did not
know that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings. Levin knew
she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him.
And this was the only thing that interested him. Not in that room only
but in the whole world
enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes
He felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy
below were all those nice excellent Karenins
world.

Quite without attracting notice
there were no other places left
Kitty side by side.

“Oh

The dinner was as choice as the china
a connoisseur. The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the
tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.
The two footmen and Matvey
dishes and wines unobtrusively
side the dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial. The
conversation
paused
from the table
Alexandrovitch thawed.


Chapter 10

Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end
satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch’s words
injustice of his view.

“I did not mean
Alexandrovitch
with fundamental ideas

“It seems to me
haste
another people is only possible to the people which has the higher
development

“But that’s just the question
always in a hurry to speak
into what he was saying. “In what are we to make higher development
consist? The English
stage of development? Which of them will nationalize the other? We see
the Rhine provinces have been turned French
a lower stage!” he shouted. “There is another law at work there.”

“I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true
civilization
eyebrows.

“But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true
civilization?” said Pestsov.

“I imagine such signs are generally very well known
Alexandrovitch.

“But are they fully known?” Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle
smile. “It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely
classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the
question
points in its favor.”

“You are for classics
Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture
Ivanovitch said
as to a child. “I only say that both sides have strong arguments to
support them
sympathies are classical from education
personally unable to arrive at a conclusion. I see no distinct grounds
for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific
studies.”

“The natural sciences have just as great an educational value
Pestsov. “Take astronomy
general principles.”

“I cannot quite agree with that
seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the
forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual
development. Moreover
classical authors is in the highest degree moral
with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and
noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.”

Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something
him in his rich bass. He began warmly contesting the justice of this
view. Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak
convincing reply ready.

“But
“One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of
classical and scientific studies is a difficult task
which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so
quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of
classical education

“Undoubtedly.”

“If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic
influence on the side of classical studies

Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile
to both tendencies. But now we know that these little pills of
classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism
we boldly prescribe them to our patients.... But what if they had no
such medicinal property?” he wound up humorously.

At Sergey Ivanovitch’s little pills
especial roared loudly and jovially
something to laugh at
conversation.

Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. With
Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant.
Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his
jest

“I can’t agree even
government obviously is guided by abstract considerations
indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise. The education
of women
harmful

And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education
of women.

Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is
apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women
only so that it can be considered dangerous.

“I consider
connected together
deprived of rights from lack of education
results from the absence of rights. We must not forget that the
subjection of women is so complete
we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from
us

“You said rights
finished
presiding at official meetings
service

“Undoubtedly.”

“But if women
to me you are wrong in using the expression ‘rights.’ It would be more
correct to say duties. Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a
juryman
duties. And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking
duties
desire to assist in the general labor of man.”

“Quite so
is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.”

“They will most likely be perfectly fitted
“when education has become general among them. We see this....”

“How about the proverb?” said the prince
intent on the conversation
say it before my daughter: her hair is long

“Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!” said
Pestsov angrily.

“What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties
Sergey Ivanovitch
avoid them.”

“Duties are bound up with rights—power
women are seeking

“Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel
injured because women are paid for the work
me

Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch
regretted that he had not made this comparison. Even Alexey
Alexandrovitch smiled.

“Yes

“No
said the old prince
before his own daughters.

“There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials
said Sergey Ivanovitch.

“Yes

all along

“If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted

Arkadyevitch was thinking of.

“But we take our stand on principle as the ideal

“And I’m oppressed and humiliated that they won’t engage me at the

Chapter 11

Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin. At
first
another
But these ideas
into his brain as in a dream
for him. It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to
talk of what was of no use to anyone. Kitty
have supposed
rights and education of women. How often she had mused on the subject
thinking of her friend abroad
dependence
of her if she did not marry
sister about it! But it did not interest her at all. She and Levin had
a conversation of their own
mysterious communication
stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which
they were entering.

At first Levin
her last year in the carriage
from the mowing along the highroad and had met her.

“It was very
awake. Your mother was asleep in the corner. It was an exquisite
morning. I was walking along wondering who it could be in a
four-in-hand? It was a splendid set of four horses with bells
second you flashed by
like this
awfully deeply about something
to know what you were thinking about then! Something important?”

“Wasn’t I dreadfully untidy?” she wondered
ecstasy these reminiscences called up
had made had been very good. She blushed and laughed with delight;
“Really I don’t remember.”

“How nicely Turovtsin laughs!” said Levin
shaking chest.

“Have you known him long?” asked Kitty.

“Oh

“And I see you think he’s a horrid man?”

“Not horrid

“Oh
Kitty. “I used to have a very poor opinion of him too
awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man. He has a heart of gold.”

“How could you find out what sort of heart he has?”

“We are great friends. I know him very well. Last winter
... you came to see us
confiding smile
happened to come and see her. And only fancy
“he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look
after the children. Yes
looked after the children like a nurse.”

“I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet
fever

“Yes
who had become aware they were talking of him
him. Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin
had not realized all this man’s goodness before.

“I’m sorry
said gaily


Chapter 12

Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of
women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in
marriage improper to discuss before the ladies. Pestsov had several
times during dinner touched upon these questions
and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them.

When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out
not follow them
the chief ground of inequality. The inequality in marriage
opinion
infidelity of the husband are punished unequally
by public opinion. Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey
Alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar.

“No
though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject
he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.

“I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of
things
this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the
conversation

“You heard
the champagne he had drunk
break the silence that had weighed on him. “Vasya Pryatchnikov
said
himself principally to the most important guest
“they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver
killed him.”

Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place
Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck
fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch’s sore spot. He would again
have got his brother-in-law away
inquired

“What did Pryatchnikov fight about?”

“His wife. Acted like a man

“Ah!” said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently
eyebrows

“How glad I am you have come
meeting him in the outer drawing-room. “I must talk to you. Let’s sit
here.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch
him by his lifted eyebrows
smiled affectedly.

“It’s fortunate
excuse me

Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna’s innocence
felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this
frigid
friend.

“Alexey Alexandrovitch

she?”

“She is

“Alexey Alexandrovitch

Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned

“I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I
consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?” he
said
Shtcherbatsky

“I don’t believe it

rose quickly
shall be disturbed here. Come this way

Dolly’s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch. He got up and
submissively followed her to the schoolroom. They sat down to a table
covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.

“I don’t
that avoided her.

“One cannot disbelieve facts
emphasis on the word “facts.”

“But what has she done?” said Darya Alexandrovna. “What precisely has
she done?”

“She has forsaken her duty
has done

“No
Dolly

Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly
signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this
warm defense
began to speak with greater heat.

“It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs
her husband of the fact—informs him that eight years of her life

“Anna and sin—I cannot connect them

“Darya Alexandrovna

When I doubted
of everything. I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my
son

He had no need to say that. Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as
he glanced into her face; and she felt sorry for him
the innocence of her friend began to totter.

“Oh
a divorce?”

“I am resolved on extreme measures. There is nothing else for me to
do.”

“Nothing else to do

“What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot

little! You are a Christian. Think of her! What will become of her

“I have thought
Alexey Alexandrovitch. His face turned red in patches
looked straight before him. Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied
him with all her heart. “That was what I did indeed when she herself
made known to me my humiliation; I left everything as of old. I gave
her a chance to reform
would not regard the slightest request—that she should observe
decorum
want to be ruined; but if the whole nature is so corrupt
that ruin itself seems to be her salvation

“Anything

“But what is anything?”

“No

“What can I do?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch
his eyebrows. The recollection of his wife’s last act had so incensed
him that he had become frigid
“I am very grateful for your sympathy
getting up.

“No
you about myself. I was married
and jealousy
I came to myself again; and who did it? Anna saved me. And here I am
living on. The children are growing up

Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her
now. All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had
sprung up again in his soul. He shook himself
loud voice:

“Forgive I cannot
done everything for this woman
to which she is akin. I am not a spiteful man
anyone
her
said

“Love those that hate you....” Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously.

Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously. That he knew long ago
it could not be applied to his case.

“Love those that hate you
Forgive me for having troubled you. Everyone has enough to bear in his
own grief!” And regaining his self-possession
quietly took leave and went away.


Chapter 13

When they rose from table
the drawing-room; but he was afraid she might dislike this
obviously paying her attention. He remained in the little ring of men
taking part in the general conversation
he was aware of her movements
in the drawing-room.

He did at once
had made her—always to think well of all men
always. The conversation fell on the village commune
saw a sort of special principle
Levin did not agree with Pestsov
special attitude of his own
significance of the Russian commune. But he talked to them
trying to reconcile and soften their differences. He was not in the
least interested in what he said himself
said; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and
contented. He knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing
was at first there
and came to a standstill at the door. Without turning round he felt the
eyes fixed on him
She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky

“I thought you were going towards the piano
“That’s something I miss in the country—music.”

“No; we only came to fetch you and thank you
with a smile that was like a gift
argue for? No one ever convinces anyone

“Yes; that’s true
warmly simply because one can’t make out what one’s opponent wants to
prove.”

Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent
people that after enormous efforts
logical subtleties and words
aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one
another had long ago
both
they liked for fear of its being attacked. He had often had the
experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his
opponent liked and at once liking it too
himself agreeing
Sometimes
what he liked himself
chancing to express it well and genuinely
once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position. He tried to say
this.

She knitted her brow
illustrate his meaning

“I know: one must find out what he is arguing for
him

She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.
Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the
confused
laconic
ideas.

Shtcherbatsky moved away from them
card-table
circles over the new green cloth.

They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner—the
liberty and occupations of women. Levin was of the opinion of Darya
Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman’s duties
in a family. He supported this view by the fact that no family can get
on without women to help; that in every family
and must be nurses

“No
her truthful eyes; “a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live
in the family without humiliation

At the hint he understood her.

“Oh

And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the
liberty of woman
maid’s existence and its humiliation in Kitty’s heart; and loving her
he felt that terror and humiliation

A silence followed. She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.
Her eyes were shining with a soft light. Under the influence of her
mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of
happiness.

“Ah! I’ve scribbled all over the table!” she said
chalk

“What! shall I be left alone—without her?” he thought with horror
he took the chalk. “Wait a minute
“I’ve long wanted to ask you one thing.”

He looked straight into her caressing

“Please

likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he
looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the
words. She glanced at him seriously
her hands and began to read. Once or twice she stole a look at him
though asking him

“I understand

“What is this word?” he said
_never_.

“It means _never_

He quickly rubbed out what he had written
stood up. She wrote

Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her
conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the
two figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand
smile looking upwards at Levin
the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the
next on her. He was suddenly radiant: he had understood. It meant
“Then I could not answer differently.”

He glanced at her questioningly

“Only then?”

“Yes

“And n... and now?” he asked.

“Well
much!” she wrote the initial letters

He snatched the chalk with nervous
wrote the initial letters of the following phrase
forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.”

She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.

“I understand

He sat down and wrote a long phrase. She understood it all
asking him

For a long while he could not understand what she had written
often looked into her eyes. He was stupefied with happiness. He could
not supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes

letters. But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her
arm

“You’re playing _secrétaire_?” said the old prince. “But we must really
be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.”

Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.

In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that
she loved him
would come tomorrow morning.

Levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly.

“Oh

“N-n-no!” said Levin.

“Where are you going?”

“I’m going to a meeting.”

“Well

“With me? Happiness is the matter with me!” said Levin
the window of the carriage they were driving in. “You don’t mind?—it’s
so stifling. It’s happiness is the matter with me! Why is it you have

Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.

“Of course it is.”

“What is your discussion about today?” asked Levin
smiling.

They arrived at the meeting. Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly
read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but
Levin saw from this secretary’s face what a good
person he was. This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in
reading the minutes. Then the discussion began. They were disputing
about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain
pipes
something at great length with an air of triumph; and another member
scribbling something on a bit of paper
afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully. And then
Sviazhsky (he was there too) said something too
nobly. Levin listened to them
and these pipes were not anything real
angry
happy and charming as possible among them. They did no harm to anyone
and were all enjoying it. What struck Levin was that he could see
through them all today
knew the soul of each
heart. And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of
that day. That was evident from the way they spoke to him
friendly

“Well

“Very much. I never supposed it was so interesting! Capital! Splendid!”

Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with
him. Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he
had disliked in Sviazhsky
clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.

“Most delighted
And from a queer association of ideas
idea of Sviazhsky’s sister-in-law was connected with marriage
occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably
speak of his happiness

Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate
presupposing
anything not done already in Europe
annoy Levin. On the contrary
the whole business was of little value
softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully
expressing his correct view. The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were
particularly delightful. It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it
already and sympathized with him
He stayed with them one hour
subjects but the one thing that filled his heart
that he was boring them dreadfully
bedtime.

Sviazhsky went with him into the hall
strange humor his friend was in. It was past one o’clock. Levin went
back to his hotel
with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through. The
servant
would have gone away
Levin had noticed before
and

“Well

“One’s got to put up with it! It’s part of our work
gentleman’s house it’s easier; but then here one makes more.”

It appeared that Yegor had a family

Yegor listened attentively
but by way of assent to it he enunciated
the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always
been satisfied with his masters
his employer

“Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!” thought Levin.

“Well
wife?”

“Ay! and why not?” responded Yegor.

And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to
express all his most heartfelt emotions.

“My life
beginning with flashing eyes
just as people catch yawning.

But at that moment a ring was heard. Yegor departed
alone. He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner
supper at Sviazhsky’s
had not slept the previous night
sleep either. His room was cold
opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table
opposite the open panes. Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a
decorated cross with chains
Charles’s Wain with the yellowish light of Capella. He gazed at the
cross
evenly into the room
memories that rose in his imagination. At four o’clock he heard steps
in the passage and peeped out at the door. It was the gambler Myaskin
whom he knew
coughing. “Poor

floors

The streets were still empty. Levin went to the house of the
Shtcherbatskys. The visitors’ doors were closed and everything was
asleep. He walked back

a walk. It was nine o’clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys’ steps
the second time. In the house they were only just up
out to go marketing. He had to get through at least two hours more.

All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously
felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life. He had
eaten nothing for a whole day
spent several hours undressed in the frozen air
fresher and stronger than ever
body; he moved without muscular effort
anything. He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of
the house

And what he saw then

were not earthly creatures. It all happened at the same time: a boy ran
towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove

quivered in the air
fresh-baked bread
was so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight.
Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka
again to the hotel
wait for twelve o’clock. In the next room they were talking about some
sort of machines
They did not realize that the hand was near twelve. The hand reached
it. Levin went out onto the steps. The sledge-drivers clearly knew all
about it. They crowded round Levin with happy faces
themselves
sledge drivers
and told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys’. The sledge-driver was
splendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and
into his strong
comfortable
and the horse was a good one
move. The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys’ house
entrance with a curve of his arm and a “Wo!” especially indicative of
respect for his fare. The Shtcherbatskys’ hall-porter certainly knew
all about it. This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way
he said:

“Well
Dmitrievitch!”

Not only he knew all about it
making efforts to conceal his joy. Looking into his kindly old eyes
Levin realized even something new in his happiness.

“Are they up?”

“Pray walk in! Leave it here
come back to take his hat. That meant something.

“To whom shall I announce your honor?” asked the footman.

The footman
a dandy
about it.

“The princess ... the prince ... the young princess....” said Levin.

The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon. She walked across the
room
spoken to her
door
terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness. Mademoiselle
Linon was in great haste
Directly she had gone out
parquet
what he had so long sought and longed for—was quickly
approaching him. She did not walk
float to him. He saw nothing but her clear
by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart. Those eyes were
shining nearer and nearer
stopped still close to him
onto his shoulders.

She had done all she could—she had run up to him and given herself up
entirely
to her mouth that sought his kiss.

She too had not slept all night
morning.

Her mother and father had consented without demur
her happiness. She had been waiting for him. She wanted to be the first
to tell him her happiness and his. She had got ready to see him alone
and had been delighted at the idea
did not know herself what she was doing. She had heard his steps and
voice
Mademoiselle Linon had gone away. Without thinking
herself how and what

“Let us go to mamma!” she said
while he could say nothing
desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word
he tried to say something
happiness were welling up. He took her hand and kissed it.

“Can it be true?” he said at last in a choked voice. “I can’t believe
you love me

She smiled at that “dear
her.

“Yes!” she said significantly

Not letting go his hands
seeing them
immediately began to laugh
expected
cheeks with her tears.

“So it is all settled! I am glad. Love her. I am glad.... Kitty!”

“You’ve not been long settling things

to him.

“I’ve long

feather-head fancied....”

“Papa!” shrieked Kitty

“Well

He embraced Kitty

And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man
so little known to him
kissed his muscular hand.


Chapter 16

The princess sat in her armchair
down beside her. Kitty stood by her father’s chair
hand. All were silent.

The princess was the first to put everything into words
translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions. And all
equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.

“When is it to be? We must have the benediction and announcement. And
when’s the wedding to be? What do you think

“Here he is
principal person in the matter.”

“When?” said Levin blushing. “Tomorrow; If you ask me
the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.”

“Come

“Well

“He’s quite mad.”

“No

“Well
haste. “How about the trousseau?”

“Will there really be a trousseau and all that?” Levin thought with
horror. “But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that—can it
spoil my happiness? Nothing can spoil it!” He glanced at Kitty
noticed that she was not in the least
by the idea of the trousseau. “Then it must be all right

“Oh
apologetically.

“We’ll talk it over
place now. That’s very well.”

The princess went up to her husband
away
kissed her several times
muddled for a moment
were in love again or their daughter. When the prince and the princess
had gone
self-possessed now and could speak
to tell her. But he said not at all what he had to say.

“How I knew it would be so! I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I
was always sure

“And I!” she said. “Even when....” She stopped and went on again
looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes
from me my happiness. I always loved you alone
I ought to tell you.... Can you forgive that?”

“Perhaps it was for the best. You will have to forgive me so much. I
ought to tell you....”

This was one of the things he had meant to speak about. He had resolved
from the first to tell her two things—that he was not chaste as she
was
considered he ought to tell her both these facts.

“No

“Very well
anything. I want to know everything. Now it is settled.”

He added: “Settled that you’ll take me whatever I may be—you won’t give
me up? Yes?”

“Yes

Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon
affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil.
Before she had gone
Then relations arrived
absurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his
wedding. Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort
but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing. He
felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him—what
did not know; and he did everything he was told
happiness. He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it
like others
spoil his special happiness; but it ended in his doing exactly as other
people did
more and more special
happened.

“Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat
Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats.

“Well
bouquets from Fomin’s.”

“Oh

His brother offered to lend him money
expenses

“Oh

And at the confectioner’s
he was expected; that they were pleased to see him
themselves on his happiness
during those days. What was extraordinary was that everyone not only
liked him
were enthusiastic over him
feeling with tenderness and delicacy
was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond
perfection. Kitty too felt the same thing. When Countess Nordston
ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better
angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be
better than Levin
Kitty’s presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic
admiration.

The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this
time. He consulted the old prince
diary
had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife. Two
things caused him anguish: his lack of purity and his lack of faith.
His confession of unbelief passed unnoticed. She was religious
never doubted the truths of religion
affect her in the least. Through love she knew all his soul
soul she saw what she wanted
called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account. The other
confession set her weeping bitterly.

Levin
that between him and her there could not be
secrets
realized what an effect it would have on her
her place. It was only when the same evening he came to their house
before the theater
pitiful
could undo
dovelike purity

“Take them
notebooks lying before her on the table. “Why did you give them me? No
it was better anyway
it’s awful

His head sank

“You can’t forgive me

“Yes

But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter
it
time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her
bowed down lower than ever before her
his undeserved happiness.


Chapter 17

Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken
place during and after dinner
solitary room. Darya Alexandrovna’s words about forgiveness had aroused
in him nothing but annoyance. The applicability or non-applicability of
the Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to
be discussed lightly
Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative. Of all that had been said
stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid
Turovtsin—“_Acted like a man
Everyone had apparently shared this feeling
they had not expressed it.

“But the matter is settled
Alexandrovitch told himself. And thinking of nothing but the journey
before him
and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was. The porter
said that the man had only just gone out. Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered
tea to be sent him
began considering the route of his journey.

“Two telegrams
pardon

Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them. The first
telegram was the announcement of Stremov’s appointment to the very post
Karenin had coveted. Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down
flushing a little
“_Quos vult perdere dementat_
responsible for this appointment. He was not so much annoyed that he
had not received the post
but it was incomprehensible
the wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last man fit for it. How could
they fail to see how they were ruining themselves
_prestige_ by this appointment?

“Something else in the same line
the second telegram. The telegram was from his wife. Her name

the first minute

“There is no deceit she would stick at. She was near her confinement.
Perhaps it is the confinement. But what can be their aim? To legitimize
the child
something was said in it: I am dying....” He read the telegram again
and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him.

“And if it is true?” he said to himself. “If it is true that in the
moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent
taking it for a trick
everyone would blame me

“Piotr

Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see
his wife. If her illness was a trick
again. If she was really in danger

duties if he came too late.

All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do.

With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the
train
through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him
thinking of what was awaiting him. He could not think about it
in picturing what would happen
that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position.
Bakers
flashed past his eyes
thought of what was awaiting him
yet was hoping for. He drove up to the steps. A sledge and a carriage
with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance. As he went into the
entry
the remotest corner of his brain
meaning ran: “If it’s a trick
truth

The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang. The
porter
slippers.

“How is your mistress?”

“A successful confinement yesterday.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white. He felt
distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death.

“And how is she?”

Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs.

“Very ill

On the hatstand there was a military overcoat. Alexey Alexandrovitch
noticed it and asked:

“Who is here?”

“The doctor

Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.

In the drawing-room there was no one; at the sound of his steps there
came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.

She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch
the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the
bedroom.

“Thank God you’ve come! She keeps on about you and nothing but you
she said.

“Make haste with the ice!” the doctor’s peremptory voice said from the
bedroom.

Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir.

“She is dying. The doctors say there is no hope. I am entirely in your

Alexey Alexandrovitch
nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people’s
suffering
without hearing the rest of his words. From the bedroom came the sound
of Anna’s voice saying something. Her voice was lively
exceedingly distinct intonations. Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the
bedroom
towards him. Her cheeks were flushed crimson

Seryozha had his dinner? I know everyone will forget him. He would not
forget. Seryozha must be moved into the corner room

All of a sudden she shrank back
expecting a blow
her face. She had seen her husband.

“No
Alexey
left to live; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand
nothing more. Now I understand

Alexey Alexandrovitch’s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony; he
took her by the hand and tried to say something
it; his lower lip quivered
emotion
at her
triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them.

“Wait a minute
stopped
yes. This is what I wanted to say. Don’t be surprised at me. I’m still
the same.... But there is another woman in me

to Rome; there’s a wilderness
anyone
forgive me! I know
good!” She held his hand in one burning hand
with the other.

The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing
by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it. He
suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the
contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new
happiness he had never known. He did not think that the Christian law
that he had been all his life trying to follow
forgive and love his enemies; but a glad feeling of love and
forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart. He knelt down
his head in the curve of her arm
the sleeve
head

“That is he. I knew him! Now
They’ve come again; why don’t they go away?... Oh
off me!”

The doctor unloosed her hands
covered her up to the shoulders. She lay back submissively
before her with beaming eyes.

“Remember one thing
nothing more.... Why doesn’t _he_ come?” she said
towards Vronsky. “Do come

Vronsky came to the side of the bed
face in his hands.

“Uncover your face—look at him! He’s a saint
your face
uncover his face! I want to see him.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky’s hands and drew them away from his
face

“Give him your hand. Forgive him.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand
tears that streamed from his eyes.

“Thank God

He would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and
said:

“I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary. I must explain my feelings
the feelings that have guided me and will guide me
be in error regarding me. You know I had resolved on a divorce

forgave her. And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my

the bliss of forgiveness!”

Tears stood in his eyes

He got up
and in a stooping
his brows. He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch’s feeling
he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with
his view of life.


Chapter 18

After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch
onto the steps of the Karenins’ house and stood still
remembering where he was
disgraced
washing away his humiliation. He felt thrust out of the beaten track
along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then. All the
habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm
suddenly false and inapplicable. The betrayed husband
till that time as a pitiful creature
ludicrous obstacle to his happiness
herself
that husband had shown himself
ludicrous
but feel this
elevation and his own abasement
felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow
been base and petty in his deceit. But this sense of his own
humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a
small part of his misery. He felt unutterably wretched now
passion for Anna
now that he knew he had lost her forever
been. He had seen all of her in her illness
soul
now when he had learned to know her
loved
leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory. Most
terrible of all had been his ludicrous
Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face. He
stood on the steps of the Karenins’ house like one distraught
not know what to do.

“A sledge

“Yes

On getting home
undressing
his head on them. His head was heavy. Images
the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary
rapidity and vividness. First it was the medicine he had poured out for
the patient and spilt over the spoon
then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the
bed.

“To sleep! To forget!” he said to himself with the serene confidence of
a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy
once. And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he
began to drop off into forgetfulness. The waves of the sea of
unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head
was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him. He
started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa
his arms got in a panic onto his knees. His eyes were wide open as
though he had never been asleep. The heaviness in his head and the
weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly
gone.

“You may trample me in the mud
and saw him standing before him
flush and glittering eyes
but at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he saw his own
and ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away
from his face. He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the
sofa in the same position and shut his eyes.

“To sleep! To forget!” he repeated to himself. But with his eyes shut
he saw more distinctly than ever Anna’s face as it had been on the
memorable evening before the races.

“That is not and will not be
memory. But I cannot live without it. How can we be reconciled? how can
we be reconciled?” he said aloud
these words. This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and
memories
words did not check his imagination for long. Again in extraordinarily
rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind

away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his
face.

He still lay down

“What’s this? Am I going out of my mind?” he said to himself. “Perhaps.
What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?”
he answered himself
embroidered cushion beside him
touched the tassel of the cushion
he had seen her last. But to think of anything extraneous was an
agonizing effort. “No
pressed his head into it
shut. He jumped up and sat down. “That’s all over for me
himself. “I must think what to do. What is left?” His mind rapidly ran
through his life apart from his love of Anna.

“Ambition? Serpuhovskoy? Society? The court?” He could not come to a
pause anywhere. All of it had had meaning before
reality in it. He got up from the sofa
belt
and down the room. “This is how people go mad
they shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation

He went to the door and closed it

his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of
thought

“Of course
clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion.
In reality this “of course

which he had passed ten times already during the last hour—memories of
happiness lost forever. There was the same conception of the
senselessness of everything to come in life

same.

The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that
seeing his wife
might be sincere
mistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him
in all its significance. But the mistake made by him had arisen not
simply from his having overlooked that contingency
fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife
not known his own heart. At his sick wife’s bedside he had for the
first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic
suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others
hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness. And pity
for her
joy of forgiveness
relief of his own sufferings
experienced before. He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the
source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy;
that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging
hating

He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse.
He forgave Vronsky
him of his despairing action. He felt more for his son than before. And
he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him. But
for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment

sleeping baby

and nose. At such moments particularly
sense of perfect peace and inward harmony
extraordinary in his position

But as time went on
natural the position now seemed to him
remain in it. He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force
controlling his soul
or more powerful
not allow him that humble peace he longed for. He felt that everyone
was looking at him with inquiring wonder
and that something was expected of him. Above all
instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.

When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed
away

She seemed to be wanting
though foreseeing their present relations could not continue
seemed to be expecting something from him.

Towards the end of February it happened that Anna’s baby daughter
had been named Anna too
nursery in the morning
for
four. Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom
and a bear fur cape

“Who is here?” asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.

“Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya
seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned.

During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that
his worldly acquaintances
in him and his wife. All these acquaintances he observed with
difficulty concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he
had perceived in the lawyer’s eyes
groom. Everyone seemed
just been at a wedding. When they met him
they inquired after his wife’s health. The presence of Princess
Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories
associated with her
straight to the nursery. In the day nursery Seryozha

Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son’s hair

“The doctor said it was nothing serious

“But she is still in pain
the baby’s screaming in the next room.

“I think it’s the wet-nurse

“What makes you think so?” he asked

“It’s just as it was at Countess Paul’s
medicine
had no milk

Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered
he went in at the other door. The baby was lying with its head thrown
back
plump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the
double hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse
over her.

“Still no better?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch.

“She’s very restless

“Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk

“I think so too

“Then why didn’t you say so?”

“Who’s one to say it to? Anna Arkadyevna still ill....” said the nurse
discontentedly.

The nurse was an old servant of the family. And in her simple words
there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.

The baby screamed louder than ever
with a gesture of despair
arms

“You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse
Alexandrovitch. The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse
frightened at the idea of losing her place
herself
doubts being cast on her abundance of milk. In that smile
Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.

“Luckless child!” said the nurse
up and down with it.

Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down
face watched the nurse walking to and fro.

When the child at last was still
the nurse
Alexandrovitch got up
baby. For a minute he was still
gazed at the baby; but all at once a smile
skin of his forehead
of the room.

In the dining-room he rang the bell
to send again for the doctor. He felt vexed with his wife for not being
anxious about this exquisite baby
wish to go to her; he had no wish
his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so
overcoming his disinclination
walked over the soft rug towards the door
overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear.

“If he hadn’t been going away
his too. But your husband ought to be above that

“It’s not for my husband; for myself I don’t wish it. Don’t say that!”
answered Anna’s excited voice.

“Yes
on your account....”

“That’s just why I don’t want to.”

With a dismayed and guilty expression
and would have gone back unobserved. But reflecting that this would be
undignified

“Ah!” she said
never put in an appearance anywhere
Anna has been ill. I have heard all about it—your anxiety. Yes
a wonderful husband!” she said
though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his
conduct to his wife.

Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly
asked how she was.

“Better

“But you’ve rather a feverish-looking color
the word “feverish.”

“We’ve been talking too much

She got up

crimson. “I won’t and can’t keep anything secret from you

Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head.

“Betsy’s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say
good-bye before his departure for Tashkend.” She did not look at her
husband
hard it might be for her. “I told her I could not receive him.”

“You said
Betsy corrected her.

“Oh

Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand.

Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big
swollen veins that sought hers

“I am very grateful to you for your confidence
feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily
and clearly by himself
who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would
inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world
hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness. He
stopped short

“Well
and went out. Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out.

“Alexey Alexandrovitch! I know you are a truly magnanimous man

shaking hands with him once more. “I am an outsider
and respect you that I venture to advise. Receive him. Alexey Vronsky
is the soul of honor

“Thank you
whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.”

He said this from habit
immediately that whatever his words might be
in his position. And he saw this by the suppressed
ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase.


Chapter 20

Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing-room
to his wife. She was lying down
hastily in her former attitude
saw she had been crying.

“I am very grateful for your confidence in me.” He repeated gently in
Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy’s presence in French
down beside her. When he spoke to her in Russian

would say.

“Yes
difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for. She especially....”

“I don’t believe a word of what’s said about her
“I know she really cares for me.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing. She played nervously
with the tassel of her dressing-gown
torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself
though she could not control it. Her only desire now was to be rid of
his oppressive presence.

“I have just sent for the doctor

“I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?”

“No

“Why didn’t you let me nurse her

but what exactly
in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of
all the good of his achievement. He believed that for Anna herself it
would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they
all thought this out of the question
relations to be renewed
and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position. Bad
as this might be

he cared for. But he felt helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone
was against him
him now so natural and right
though it seemed the proper thing to them.


Chapter 21

Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room
the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch
where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received.

“Ah! princess! what a delightful meeting!” he began. “I’ve been to see
you.”

“A meeting for one minute
putting on her glove.

“Don’t put on your glove yet
nothing I’m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the
kissing the hand.” He kissed Betsy’s hand. “When shall we see each
other?”

“You don’t deserve it

“Oh
person. I don’t only manage my own affairs
said

“Oh
speaking of Anna. And going back into the drawing-room
corner. “He’s killing her
“It’s impossible

“I’m so glad you think so
with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression
I’ve come to Petersburg for.”

“The whole town’s talking of it
position. She pines and pines away. He doesn’t understand that she’s
one of those women who can’t trifle with their feelings. One of two
things: either let him take her away
divorce. This is stifling her.”

“Yes
come for. At least not solely for that ... I’ve been made a
_Kammerherr_; of course
was having to settle this.”

“Well

After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall

be angry
tears.

Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits
Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic
poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood. He asked her
how she was

“Very
days to come

“I think you’re giving way to pessimism. You must rouse yourself
must look life in the face. I know it’s hard

“I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices

but....”

She would have said death

“You are ill and overwrought
exaggerating dreadfully. There’s nothing so terrible in it.”

And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s
place
(the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so
much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not
wound
were as soothing and softening as almond oil. And Anna soon felt this.

“No
yet that all is over; on the contrary
an overstrained string that must snap. But it’s not ended yet ... and
it will have a fearful end.”

“No matter
There’s no position from which there is no way of escape.”

“I have thought

Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in
her thought was death

“Not at all
as I can. Let me tell you candidly my opinion.” Again he smiled
discreetly his almond-oil smile. “I’ll begin from the beginning. You
married a man twenty years older than yourself. You married him without
love and not knowing what love was. It was a mistake

“A fearful mistake!” said Anna.

“But I repeat
misfortune to love a man not your husband. That was a misfortune; but
that
forgave it.” He stopped at each sentence
but she made no answer. “That’s so. Now the question is: can you go on
living with your husband? Do you wish it? Does he wish it?”

“I know nothing

“But you said yourself that you can’t endure him.”

“No
about it.”

“Yes

“You can’t understand. I feel I’m lying head downwards in a sort of
pit

“Never mind
you: I understand that you can’t take it on yourself to express your
wishes

“There’s nothing

“But he sees this and knows it. And do you suppose it weighs on him any
less than on you? You’re wretched
come of it? while divorce would solve the difficulty completely.” With
some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea
looked significantly at her.

She said nothing
look in her face
that if she did not desire this
unattainable happiness.

“I’m awfully sorry for you! And how happy I should be if I could
arrange things!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch

Anna looked at him with dreamy

Stepan Arkadyevitch
which he used to take his presidential chair at his board
Alexey Alexandrovitch’s room. Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about
his room with his hands behind his back
Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife.

“I’m not interrupting you?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
his brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment
unusual with him. To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette
case he had just bought that opened in a new way
leather

“No. Do you want anything?” Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without
eagerness.

“Yes
Stepan Arkadyevitch

This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe
it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to
do was wrong.

Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that
had come over him.

“I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection
and respect for you

Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing
Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.

“I intended ... I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister
and your mutual position
unaccustomed constraint.

Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully
and without answering went up to the table
letter

“I think unceasingly of the same thing. And here is what I had begun
writing

Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter
at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him

“I see that my presence is irksome to you. Painful as it is to me to
believe it

illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed
between us and to begin a new life. I do not regret

yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul. I
put myself entirely in your hands
right.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter
continued looking at his brother-in-law
silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch’s lips
began twitching nervously
Karenin’s face.

“That’s what I wanted to say to her
turning away.

“Yes
tears that were choking him.

“Yes

“I want to know what she would like

“I am afraid she does not understand her own position. She is not a
judge

would be incapable of saying anything
lower than ever.”

“Yes

“If you will allow me to give my opinion
to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the
position.”

“So you consider it must be ended?” Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted
him. “But how?” he added
not usual with him. “I see no possible way out of it.”

“There is some way of getting out of every position
Arkadyevitch
when you thought of breaking off.... If you are convinced now that you
cannot make each other happy....”

“Happiness may be variously understood. But suppose that I agree to
everything
our position?”

“If you care to know my opinion

talking to Anna. His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey

it

“She will never speak out about it. But one thing is possible
thing she might desire
relations and all memories associated with them. To my thinking
your position what’s essential is the formation of a new attitude to
one another. And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both
sides.”

“Divorce

“Yes
repeated
rational course for married people who find themselves in the position
you are in. What can be done if married people find that life is
impossible for them together? That may always happen.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes.

Divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty
grounds.

What would become of his son in case of a divorce? To leave him with
his mother was out of the question. The divorced mother would have her

an act of vengeance on his part

Alexandrovitch was
completely ruining Anna. The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow

his life and to which he would have to submit.

“The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce.

“My God

And turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him
down on a chair at the window. There was bitterness

Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched. He was silent for a space.

When he went out of his brother-in-law’s room he was touched

matter to a conclusion

an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful

ways. “But I’ll work it out better than that

Without answering his words

Princess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for
the wedding to take place before Lent

it off too late

wedding before Lent. She determined that she would get the smaller part

everything suggested to him. His brother raised money for him
princess advised him to leave Moscow after the wedding. Stepan
Arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad. He agreed to everything. “Do
what you choose
no greater and no less for anything you do
Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s advice that they should go abroad
was much surprised that she did not agree to this
definite requirements of her own in regard to their future. She knew
Levin had work he loved in the country. She did not
understand this work
did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance.
And then she knew their home would be in the country
go
their home would be. This definitely expressed purpose astonished
Levin. But since he did not care either way
Stepan Arkadyevitch
country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with
the taste of which he had so much.

“But I say
back from the country
people’s arrival
confession?”

“No. But what of it?”

“You can’t be married without it.”

“_Aïe
I’ve taken the sacrament! I never thought of it.”

“You’re a pretty fellow!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch laughing
call me a Nihilist! But this won’t do
sacrament.”

“When? There are four days left now.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also
confession. To Levin
others
in church ceremonies. At this moment
feeling
not merely painful to Levin
in the heyday of his highest glory
to be a liar or a scoffer. He felt incapable of being either. But
though he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the
possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating
Stepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question.

“Besides
old fellow. He’ll pull the tooth out for you so gently
notice it.”

Standing at the first litany
youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed
through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.

But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him. He
attempted to look at it all as an empty custom
meaning
do that either. Levin found himself
contemporaries
he could not
was all wrong. And consequently
significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as
an empty formality
sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at
doing what he did not himself understand
told him

During the service he would first listen to the prayers
attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then
feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them
not to listen to them
memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during
this idle time of standing in church.

He had stood through the litany
service
having tea went at eight o’clock in the morning to the church for the
morning service and the confession.

There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier
the church officials. A young deacon
distinct halves through his thin undercassock
going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation. During the
reading
words
felt that thought was shut and sealed up
touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so
standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs
neither listening nor examining what was said. “It’s wonderful what
expression there is in her hand
been sitting the day before at a corner table. They had nothing to talk
about
on the table she kept opening and shutting it
she watched her action. He remembered how he had kissed it and then had
examined the lines on the pink palm. “Have mercy on us again!” thought
Levin
the deacon’s back bowing before him. “She took my hand then and
examined the lines ‘You’ve got a splendid hand
looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon. “Yes
will soon be over

is bowing down to the ground. That’s always at the end.”

The deacon’s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note
unobtrusively
register
the empty church
thence and beckoned to Levin. Thought
stir in Levin’s head
right somehow
up the steps

eyes

in the official voice. When he had finished them he bowed down to the
ground and turned

“Christ is present here unseen
pointing to the crucifix. “Do you believe in all the doctrines of the
Holy Apostolic Church?” the priest went on
Levin’s face and folding his hands under his stole.

“I have doubted
on himself

The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more
closing his eyes he said quickly

“Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind
in His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special sins?” he added
without the slightest interval

“My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything
part I am in doubt.”

“Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind
same words. “What do you doubt about principally?”

“I doubt of everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the existence
of God
impropriety of what he was saying. But Levin’s words did not
seemed

“What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?” he said
hurriedly

Levin did not speak.

“What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?”
the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon. “Who has decked the
heavenly firmament with its lights? Who has clothed the earth in its
beauty? How explain it without the Creator?” he said
inquiringly at Levin.

Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical
discussion with the priest
direct answer to the question.

“I don’t know

“You don’t know! Then how can you doubt that God created all?” the
priest said

“I don’t understand it at all
his words were stupid
in such a position.

“Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts
prayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great power
we must resist him. Pray to God
hurriedly.

The priest paused for some time

“You’re about
in the spirit
excellent young lady.”

“Yes
ask me about this at confession for?” he thought.

And

“You are about to enter into holy matrimony
offspring. Well
you do not overcome the temptation of the devil
infidelity?” he said
child as a good father
for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation
enlightenment with the light of truth. Eh? What answer will you make
him when the innocent babe asks you: ‘Papa! who made all that enchants
me in this world—the earth
grass?’ Can you say to him: ‘I don’t know’? You cannot but know
the Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us. Or your child
will ask you: ‘What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?’ What will
you say to him when you know nothing? How will you answer him? Will you
leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil? That’s not
right
looking at Levin with his kindly

Levin made no answer this time
upon a discussion with the priest
asked him such questions
questions

“You are entering upon a time of life
must choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that He may in His
mercy aid you and have mercy on you!” he concluded. “Our Lord and God
Jesus Christ
forgives this child....” and
priest blessed him and dismissed him.

On getting home that day

having to tell a lie. Apart from this
that what the kind
stupid as he had fancied at first
that must be cleared up.

“Of course
felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not
clean in his soul
position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others
which he blamed his friend Sviazhsky.

Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly’s
high spirits. To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement
in which he found himself
trained to jump through a hoop
and done what was required of him
up to the table and the windows in its delight.


Chapter 2

On the day of the wedding
princess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the
customs)
three bachelor friends
were Sergey Ivanovitch
of natural science
taking home with him
conciliation-board judge
dinner was a very merry one: Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest
mood
feeling his originality was appreciated and understood
of it. Tchirikov always gave a lively and good-humored support to
conversation of any sort.

“See
the lecture-room
Dmitrievitch. I’m not speaking of present company
the time he left the university he was fond of science
interest in humanity; now one-half of his abilities is devoted to
deceiving himself

“A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw
Sergey Ivanovitch.

“Oh
labor. People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the
rest work for their happiness and enlightenment. That’s how I look at
it. To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur; I’m not one of
their number.”

“How happy I shall be when I hear that you’re in love!” said Levin.
“Please invite me to the wedding.”

“I’m in love now.”

“Yes
“Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of
the....”

“Now
is

“But that’s no hindrance to your loving your wife.”

“The cuttlefish is no hindrance. The wife is the hindrance.”

“Why so?”

“Oh
look out!”

“Arhip was here today; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno
two bears

“Well

“Ah
good-bye to bear-hunting for the future—your wife won’t allow it!”

Levin smiled. The picture of his wife not letting him go was so
pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon
bears forever.

“Still
remember last time at Hapilovo? That was a delightful hunt!” said
Tchirikov.

Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there
could be something delightful apart from her

“There’s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachelor
life
regret your freedom.”

“And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the
window

“Of course there is
broke into loud laughter.

“Oh
There’s a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair. Seriously
let’s go by the five o’clock! And here let them do what they like
said Tchirikov

“Well
heart that feeling of regret for my freedom.”

“Yes
anything there
a little

“No; if so
could not say love before them) “and happiness
losing my freedom.... On the contrary
freedom.”

“Awful! It’s a hopeless case!” said Katavasov. “Well
his recovery
realized—and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on
earth!”

Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for
the wedding.

When he was left alone
friends
freedom of which they had spoken? He smiled at the question. “Freedom!
What is freedom for? Happiness is only in loving and wishing her
wishes
all—that’s happiness!”

“But do I know her ideas
suddenly whispered to him. The smile died away from his face
grew thoughtful. And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him. There
came over him a dread and doubt—doubt of everything.

“What if she does not love me? What if she’s marrying me simply to be
married? What if she doesn’t see herself what she’s doing?” he asked
himself. “She may come to her senses
married realize that she does not and cannot love me.” And strange
most evil thoughts of her began to come to him. He was jealous of
Vronsky
her with Vronsky had been yesterday. He suspected she had not told him
everything.

He jumped up quickly. “No
despair. “I’ll go to her; I’ll ask her; I’ll say for the last time: we
are free

hotel and drove to her house.

He found her in one of the back rooms. She was sitting on a chest and
making some arrangements with her maid
of different colors

“Ah!” she cried
Konstantin Dmitrievitch!” (These latter days she used these names
almost alternately.) “I didn’t expect you! I’m going through my
wardrobe to see what’s for whom....”

“Oh! that’s very nice!” he said gloomily

“You can go
what’s the matter?” she asked
as soon as the maid had gone out. She noticed his strange face
agitated and gloomy

“Kitty! I’m in torture. I can’t suffer alone
his voice
He saw already from her loving
of what he had meant to say
herself. “I’ve come to say that there’s still time. This can all be
stopped and set right.”

“What? I don’t understand. What is the matter?”

“What I have said a thousand times over
that I’m not worthy of you. You couldn’t consent to marry me. Think a
little. You’ve made a mistake. Think it over thoroughly. You can’t love
me.... If ... better say so
wretched. Let people say what they like; anything’s better than
misery.... Far better now while there’s still time....”

“I don’t understand
to give it up ... don’t want it?”

“Yes

“You’re out of your mind!” she cried
But his face was so piteous
flinging some clothes off an armchair
are you thinking? tell me all.”

“I am thinking you can’t love me. What can you love me for?”

“My God! what can I do?...” she said

“Oh! what have I done?” he cried
kissing her hands.

When the princess came into the room five minutes later
completely reconciled. Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved
him
for—as to explain what for. She told him that she loved him because she
understood him completely
because everything he liked was good. And this seemed to him perfectly
clear. When the princess came to them

to her
Dunyasha must have the blue one.

“How is it you don’t see? She’s a brunette
I’ve worked it all out.”

was no time to lose. Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to
fetch her curled and pomaded son
after the bride. Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man

back.... Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to
be considered and arranged. One thing was unmistakable

Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy

hurry to get off
destinations of the various carriages.

“Come

and then send his carriage.”

“Of course; I shall be delighted.”

“We’ll come on directly with him. Are your things sent off?” said
Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“Yes

Chapter 3

A crowd of people
lighted up for the wedding. Those who had not succeeded in getting into
the main entrance were crowding about the windows
and peeping through the gratings.

More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the
street by the police. A police officer
at the entrance
continually driving up
trains
into the church. Inside the church both lusters were already lighted
and all the candles before the holy pictures. The gilt on the red
ground of the holy picture-stand
and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks
floor
of the altar
surplices—all were flooded with light. On the right side of the warm
church
broadcloth
and long gloves
strangely in the high cupola. Every time there was heard the creak of
the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away
looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in. But the
door had opened more than ten times
belated guest or guests
right
and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left. Both the guests
and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of
anticipation.

At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive
immediately
Then they began to look more and more often towards the door
talk of whether anything could have happened. Then the long delay began
to be positively discomforting
as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in
conversation.

The head deacon
coughed impatiently
the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and
blowing their noses. The priest was continually sending first the
beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not
come
embroidered sash
last one of the ladies
strange
expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction. One of the bridegroom’s
best men went to find out what had happened. Kitty meanwhile had long
ago been quite ready
of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the
Shtcherbatskys’ house with her sister
bridal-mother. She was looking out of the window
half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her
bridegroom was at the church.

Levin meanwhile
was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel
his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor. But in
the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he
came back in despair
Arkadyevitch

“Was ever a man in such a fearful fool’s position?” he said.

“Yes
“But don’t worry

“No
fools of open waistcoats! Out of the question!” he said
crumpled front of his shirt. “And what if the things have been taken on
to the railway station!” he roared in desperation.

“Then you must put on mine.”

“I ought to have done so long ago

“It’s not nice to look ridiculous.... Wait a bit! it will _come
round_.”

The point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit
old servant
was wanted.

“But the shirt!” cried Levin.

“You’ve got a shirt on

Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt
instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the
Shtcherbatskys’ house
same evening
The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question
with the fashionable open waistcoat. It was a long way to send to the
Shtcherbatskys’. They sent out to buy a shirt. The servant came back;
everything was shut up—it was Sunday. They sent to Stepan
Arkadyevitch’s and brought a shirt—it was impossibly wide and short.
They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys’ to unpack the things. The
bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down
his room like a wild beast in a cage
and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to
Kitty and what she might be thinking now.

At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.

“Only just in time. They were just lifting it into the van
Kouzma.

Three minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor
at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings.

“You won’t help matters like this

it will come round ... I tell you.”

into the church.

Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay
guests were whispering it with smiles to one another. Levin saw nothing
and no one; he did not take his eyes off his bride.

Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late
nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual; but Levin did not think
so. He looked at her hair done up high
white flowers and the high
maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in
front

from Paris added anything to her beauty; but because

set straight the flowers on her head.

Dolly came up
then laughed unnaturally.

Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.

Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments
priest and deacon came out to the lectern
of the church. The priest turned to Levin saying something. Levin did
not hear what the priest said.

“Take the bride’s hand and lead her up

It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of
him. For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin
again—because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong
arm—till he understood at last that what he had to do was
changing his position
at last he had taken the bride’s hand in the correct way
walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern. The
crowd of friends and relations moved after them
and a rustle of skirts. Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride’s
train. The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard
falling from the candles.

The little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap
silvery-gray locks of hair parted behind his ears
something at the lectern

Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously
making a sign to Levin

The priest lighted two candles

He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom

Levin heard the words

When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family

“Amen!” the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air.

“‘Joinest together in love them that were separate.’ What deep meaning
in those words
moment

And looking round
concluded that she was understanding it just as he was. But this was a
mistake; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the
service; she had not heard them
and take them in
and grew stronger and stronger. That feeling was joy at the completion
of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in
her soul
her. On the day when in the drawing-room of the house in Arbaty Street
she had gone up to him in her brown dress
without a word—on that day
a complete severance from all her old life
utterly strange life had begun for her
going on as before. Those six weeks had for her been a time of the
utmost bliss and the utmost misery. All her life
hopes were concentrated on this one man
to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and
repulsion
while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old
life. Living the old life
insurmountable callousness to all her own past
to the people she had loved
wounded by her indifference
dearer than all the world. At one moment she was horrified at this
indifference
indifference. She could not frame a thought
with this man; but this new life was not yet
picture it clearly to herself. There was only anticipation
and joy of the new and the unknown. And now behold—anticipation and
uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life—all was
ending
terrors for her inexperience; but
wrought six weeks before in her soul
sanction of what had long been completed in her heart.

Turning again to the lectern

put on their own ring died away on his lips. He had a feeling that any

Levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage

rose higher and higher

“They say if anyone’s best man more than ten times

on him.

Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile. She looked at Kitty
thinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty’s
place

Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor
meant to put the crown on Kitty’s chignon for luck.

“She ought not to have worn a chignon
had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was
angling for married her
don’t like such grandeur.”

Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna
her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common
because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of
themselves.

“Your brother may feel proud of himself. She’s a marvel of sweetness. I
believe you’re envious.”

women-friends and acquaintances. She thought of them on the one day of
their triumph
with love and hope and dread in their hearts
stepping forward into the mysterious future. Among the brides that came
back to her memory
proposed divorce she had just been hearing. And she had stood just as
innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil. And now? “It’s terribly

They prayed: “Endow them with continence and fruitfulness

“and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother

Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and
congratulated the young people. Levin looked at Kitty

Chapter 7

Vronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in
Europe. They had visited Venice
at a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time. A handsome

arranged. The steward was prepared to sign the agreement.

“Ah! I’m glad to hear it

Vronsky took off his soft
over his heated brow and hair
was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head. And glancing
casually at the gentleman
him

“This gentleman is a Russian
head waiter.

With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from
acquaintances anywhere
the monotony of his life
who had retreated and stood still again
came into the eyes of both.

“Golenishtchev!”

“Vronsky!”

It really was Golenishtchev
Pages. In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party; he
left the corps without entering the army
under the government. Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways
on leaving the corps

At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a
sort of lofty
disposed to look down upon Vronsky’s interests and calling in life.
Hence Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so
well knew how to assume
dislike my way of life
indifference to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want
to know me.” Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the
tone taken by Vronsky. This second meeting might have been expected
one would have supposed
beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another. Vronsky
would never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev
probably he was not himself aware how bored he was. He forgot the
disagreeable impression of their last meeting
delight held out his hand to his old comrade. The same expression of
delight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev’s face.

“How glad I am to meet you!” said Vronsky
teeth in a friendly smile.

“I heard the name Vronsky
glad!”

“Let’s go in. Come

“I’ve been living here for two years. I’m working.”

“Ah! I did not know” (though he did know)

“Four days

“Yes
Vronsky said to himself
face and the change of subject. “I can introduce him to Anna
at it properly.”

During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna
had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would
look at his relations with Anna
met with the “proper” way of looking at it. But if he had been asked

life is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety
allusions and unpleasant questions. They assumed an air of fully
comprehending the import and force of the situation
even approving of it
for to put all this into words.

Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class
therefore was doubly pleased to see him. And in fact
manner to Madame Karenina
that Vronsky could have desired. Obviously without the slightest effort
he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.

He had never met Anna before
more by the frankness with which she accepted her position. She blushed
when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev
this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face. But
what he liked particularly was the way in which at once
purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider
called Vronsky simply Alexey

“I tell you what: it’s a lovely day

“I shall be very glad to; I’ll go and put on my hat. Would you say it’s

at Vronsky. And again a vivid flush overspread her face.

Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared

He looked a long

Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the
first part of the _Two Elements_
something well known. But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his
opinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the
_Two Elements_
Golenishtchev spoke well. But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the
nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject
that engrossed him. As he went on talking
more angrily; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary
opponents

Anna
health
The thought of her husband’s unhappiness did not poison her happiness.
On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of. On the other
side her husband’s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be
regretted. The memory of all that had happened after her illness: her
reconciliation with her husband
wound

The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling
like repulsion
shaken off another man clinging to him. That man did drown. It was an
evil action
not to brood over these fearful facts.

One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the
first moment of the final rupture

I too am suffering
everything—I am losing my good name and my son. I have done wrong
so I don’t want happiness

Anna had meant to suffer
With the tact of which both had such a large share
in avoiding Russian ladies abroad
in a false position
that they perfectly understood their position
they did themselves. Separation from the son she loved—even that did
not cause her anguish in these early days. The baby girl—_his_
child—was so sweet
was left her

The desire for life

felt unpardonably happy. The more she got to know Vronsky

Her adoration of him alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find
in him anything not fine. She dared not show him her sense of her own
insignificance beside him. It seemed to her that
might sooner cease to love her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as
losing his love
could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her
showing that she appreciated it. He

sake

care with which he surrounded her

Vronsky
so long desired
realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of
the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake
men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of
their desires. For a time after joining his life to hers
on civilian dress
which he had known nothing before
was content
springing up in his heart a desire for desires—_ennui_. Without
conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice

of the place—foreign and Russian—were equally out of the question owing
to the irregularity of their position. The inspection of objects of
interest
had not for Vronsky
significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit.

And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get

their criticisms he fancied that he had found this.

He walked rapidly to the door of his studio

On entering the studio
noted down in his imagination Vronsky’s expression too
his jaws. Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work
collecting materials
excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer
rapidly and subtly formed
these three persons.

That fellow (Golenishtchev) was a Russian living here. Mihailov did not
remember his surname nor where he had met him
him. He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had
ever seen; but he remembered
in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and
poor in expression. The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an
appearance of consequence to the face
petty
of the narrow nose. Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be
supposed

connoisseurs. “Most likely they’ve already looked at all the antiques

the worse he found them) of looking at the works of contemporary

a thing of the past
one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have
remained. He expected all this; he saw it all in their faces
in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves

while he was turning over his studies
off the sheet

with emotion. He moved away and stood behind them.

For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the
picture in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of
an outsider. For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a
higher
visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before. He forgot all
he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had
been painting it; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely
certain to him—he saw the picture with their indifferent
eyes

happening. Every face that

The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too
intolerable to him. To break it
made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.

“To be sure! We met at Rossi’s

“Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and
what strikes me particularly now
Pilate. One so knows the man: a good-natured
official through and through
But I fancy....”

All Mihailov’s mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled. He tried
to say something
to be coughing. Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev’s capacity for
understanding art
the expression of Pilate as an official
seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was
said of more serious points
this observation. He had himself thought about Pilate’s figure just
what Golenishtchev said. The fact that this reflection was but one of
millions of reflections

remark. His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark
state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy. At once the whole of
his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of
everything living. Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he
understood Pilate
pronounce the words. Vronsky and Anna too said something in that
subdued voice in which
and partly to avoid saying out loud something silly—so easily said when
talking of art—people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures.
Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too.
He went up to them.

“How marvelous Christ’s expression is!” said Anna. Of all she saw she
liked that expression most of all
of the picture
“One can see that He is pitying Pilate.”

This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found
in his picture and in the figure of Christ. She said that He was
pitying Pilate. In Christ’s expression there ought to be indeed an
expression of pity
peace
course there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in
Christ
of the spiritual life. All this and much more flashed into Mihailov’s
thoughts.

“Yes
it
did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.

“Yes
the background stand out! There you have technique
addressing Golenishtchev
Vronsky’s despair of attaining this technique.

“Yes
excited condition in which he was
sent a pang to Mihailov’s heart
suddenly scowled. He had often heard this word technique
utterly unable to understand what was understood by it. He knew that by
this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing
entirely apart from its subject. He had noticed often that even in
actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality
could paint well something that was bad. He knew that a great deal of
attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings
injuring the creation itself
there was no art of painting—no technique of any sort—about it. If to a
little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw
have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen. And the most
experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility
paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him
first. Besides
was impossible to praise him for it. In all he had painted and
repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes
taking off the wrappings—faults he could not correct now without
spoiling the whole. And in almost all the figures and faces he saw
too
picture.

“One thing might be said
observed Golenishtchev.

“Oh
smile.

“That is
know that was what you meant to do.”

“I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart
gloomily.

“Yes; but in that case
Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it
and
Your very motive is different. But let us take Ivanov. I imagine that
if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character
would have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical
subject

“But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?”

“If one looked one would find others. But the point is that art cannot
suffer doubt and discussion. And before the picture of Ivanov the
question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike
or is it not God?’ and the unity of the impression is destroyed.”

“Why so? I think that for educated people
question cannot exist.”

Golenishtchev did not agree with this
support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being
essential to art.

Mihailov was greatly perturbed
his own idea.

Anna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances

“Oh
cried with one voice.

“What is it they’re so pleased with?” thought Mihailov. He had
positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago. He
had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through
with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought
haunting him day and night. He had forgotten
pictures he had finished. He did not even like to look at it
only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted
to buy it.

“Oh

“How fine!” said Golenishtchev

Russian artists. But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on

Mihailov sold Vronsky his picture
Anna. On the day fixed he came and began the work.

From the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone
Vronsky
It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her
characteristic beauty. “One needs to know and love her as I have loved

true that he

In another man’s house
was quite a different man from what he was in his studio. He behaved
with hostile courtesy

portrait. Vronsky was more than cordial with him
interested to know the artist’s opinion of his picture. Golenishtchev
never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into
Mihailov. But Mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them. Anna was
aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her
conversation with her. Vronsky’s talk about his painting he met with
stubborn silence
Vronsky’s picture. He was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev’s
conversation

Altogether Mihailov
hostile attitude
better; and they were glad when the sittings were over
left with a magnificent portrait in their possession
coming. Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that
had occurred to all of them
of Vronsky.

“Not envious
a wealthy man of the highest society
all detest a title)
if not better
than all

Vronsky defended Mihailov
it
to be envious.

Anna’s portrait—the same subject painted from nature both by him and by
Mihailov—ought to have shown Vronsky the difference between him and
Mihailov; but he did not see it. Only after Mihailov’s portrait was
painted he left off painting his portrait of Anna
now not needed. His picture of mediæval life he went on with. And he
himself
because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than
Mihailov’s picture.

Mihailov meanwhile
was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over
had no longer to listen to Golenishtchev’s disquisitions upon art
could forget about Vronsky’s painting. He knew that Vronsky could not
be prevented from amusing himself with painting; he knew that he and
all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked
distasteful to him. A man could not be prevented from making himself a
big wax doll
and sit before a man in love
caressed the woman he loved
such a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt at the sight of
Vronsky’s painting: he felt it both ludicrous and irritating
pitiable and offensive.

Vronsky’s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long.
He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture.
The picture came to a standstill. He was vaguely aware that its
defects
with it. The same experience befell him as Golenishtchev
he had nothing to say
that his idea was not yet mature
collecting materials. This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev
Vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself

Levin had been married three months. He was happy

mournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her head over the young
mistress’s new arrangements. He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily
sweet when

Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels. Levin
could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations
could arise other than tender
in the very early days they quarreled
for her

This first quarrel arose from Levin’s having gone out to a new
farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long
tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way. He drove home
thinking of nothing but her
nearer he drew to home
into the room with the same feeling
he had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys’ house to make his offer.
And suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in
her. He would have kissed her; she pushed him away.

Never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity

rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering. One habitual
feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her.

under such undeserved reproach was wretched

they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all
this early period they were both often in a bad temper. When one was in
a good temper

afterwards what they had quarreled about. It is true that when they
were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled. But
still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for
them.

During all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of
tension
which they were bound. Altogether their honeymoon—that is to say
month after their wedding—from which from tradition Levin expected so
much
memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their
lives. They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their
memories all the monstrous
when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind
themselves.

It was only in the third month of their married life
return from Moscow
life began to go more smoothly.

They had just come back from Moscow
sitting at the writing-table in his study
dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married
life

which had always stood in the study in Levin’s father’s and
grandfather’s days. She was sewing at _broderie anglaise_. He thought

they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that
lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness. He went
on with his work
attention had passed to something else
at his work quite differently and more clearly. Formerly this work had
been for him an escape from life. Formerly he had felt that without
this work his life would be too gloomy. Now these pursuits were
necessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright. Taking
up his manuscript
pleasure that the work was worth his working at. Many of his old ideas
seemed to him superfluous and extreme
to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory. He was writing
now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of
agriculture in Russia. He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises
not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and
misdirected reforms
this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon
Russia

arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into

like culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready.

But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone

herself was not to blame (she could not be to blame for anything)
what was to blame was her education
(“That fool Tcharsky: she wanted
how to.”) “Yes
apart from dress and _broderie anglaise_
No interest in her work

not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of
activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife
of her husband and mistress of the house
and bring up children. He knew not that she was instinctively aware of
this
reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her
love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future.

When Levin went upstairs

“You see

“I did not read it through. This is from my people and from Dolly.
Fancy! Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children’s ball at the
Sarmatskys’: Tanya was a French marquise.”

But Levin did not hear her. Flushing
Nikolaevna
was the second letter he had received from Marya Nikolaevna. In the
first letter
for no fault of hers
she was in want again
but was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would
come to grief without her
begged his brother to look after him. Now she wrote quite differently.
She had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch

received a post in the government service. But that he had quarreled
with the head official

leave his bed again
besides

“Read this; Dolly writes about you
but she stopped suddenly

“What is it? What’s the matter?”

“She writes to me that Nikolay

Kitty’s face changed at once. Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise

“When are you going?” she said.

“Tomorrow.”

“And I will go with you

“Kitty! What are you thinking of?” he said reproachfully.

“How do you mean?” offended that he should seem to take her suggestion
unwillingly and with vexation. “Why shouldn’t I go? I shan’t be in your
way. I....”

“I’m going because my brother is dying
you....”

“Why? For the same reason as you.”

“And
dull by herself
such gravity infuriated him.

“It’s out of the question

Agafea Mihalovna
down her cup and withdrew. Kitty did not even notice her. The tone in
which her husband had said the last words wounded her
because he evidently did not believe what she had said.

“I tell you
come
do you say it’s out of the question?”

“Because it’ll be going God knows where
all sorts of hotels. You would be a hindrance to me
trying to be cool.

“Not at all. I don’t want anything. Where you can go

“Well

“I don’t know and don’t care to know who’s there and what. I know that
my husband’s brother is dying and my husband is going to him
with my husband too....”

“Kitty! Don’t get angry. But just think a little: this is a matter of
such importance that I can’t bear to think that you should bring in a
feeling of weakness

“There

wasn’t ... I feel that it’s my duty to be with my husband when he’s in

“No; this is awful! To be such a slave!” cried Levin
unable to restrain his anger any longer. But at the same second he felt
that he was beating himself.

“Then why did you marry? You could have been free. Why did you
regret it?” she said
drawing-room.

When he went to her

He began to speak

He bent down to her and took her hand

But when he took her face in both his hands and said “Kitty!” she
suddenly recovered herself

It was decided that they should go together the next day. Levin told
his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of
use
her going improper
dissatisfied both with her and with himself. He was dissatisfied with
her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was
necessary (and how strange it was for him to think that he

him—now was unhappy because she loved him too much!)
dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will. Even
greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as
to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother

As is invariably the case

one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads
by a lawyer from Moscow

promised that another should be empty by the evening. Feeling angry
with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass
that at the moment of arrival
anxiety to know how his brother was getting on
seeing after her
conducted her to the room assigned them.

“Well

“Very bad. He can’t get up. He has kept expecting you. He.... Are you
... with your wife?”

Levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her
but she immediately enlightened him.

“I’ll go away. I’ll go down to the kitchen
Dmitrievitch will be delighted. He heard about it
and remembers her abroad.”

Levin realized that she meant his wife
make.

“Come along

But as soon as he moved
out. Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife
put herself and him in such a difficult position; but Marya Nikolaevna
crimsoned still more. She positively shrank together and flushed to the
point of tears
twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to
do.

For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the
eyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman
to her; but it lasted only a single instant.

“Well! how is he?” she turned to her husband and then to her.

“But one can’t go on talking in the passage like this!” Levin said
looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant
across the corridor

“Well then
recovered herself
on; go

Levin went to his brother’s room. He had not in the least expected what
he saw and felt in his brother’s room. He had expected to find him in
the same state of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent
with the consumptive
brother’s visit in the autumn. He had expected to find the physical
signs of the approach of death more marked—greater weakness
emaciation
expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother
he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then
in a greater degree. And he had prepared himself for this; but he found
something utterly different.

In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with

on the temples and tense

“It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay?” thought
Levin. But he went closer
In spite of the terrible change in the face
at those eager eyes raised at his approach
movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache
terrible truth that this death-like body was his living brother.

The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as
he drew near. And immediately this glance established a living
relationship between living men. Levin immediately felt the reproach in
the eyes fixed on him

When Konstantin took him by the hand
faint
expression of the eyes was unchanged.

“You did not expect to find me like this

“Yes ... no
didn’t let me know before
inquiries in all directions.”

He had to talk so as not to be silent
especially as his brother made no reply
dropping his eyes
each word. Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him.
Nikolay expressed pleasure
by his condition. A silence followed. Suddenly Nikolay stirred
began to say something. Levin expected something of peculiar gravity
and importance from the expression of his face
speaking of his health. He found fault with the doctor
had not a celebrated Moscow doctor. Levin saw that he still hoped.

Seizing the first moment of silence
if only for an instant
would go and fetch his wife.

“Very well
here

looking inquiringly at his brother.

Levin made no answer. Going out into the corridor
had said he would fetch his wife
he was feeling
persuade her not to go in to the sick man. “Why should she suffer as I
am suffering?” he thought.

“Well

“Oh

“Kostya! take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.
You only take me

painful. There I might be a help to you and to him. Please
she besought her husband
on it.

Levin was obliged to agree
forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now
brother with Kitty.

Stepping lightly
a valorous and sympathetic face
turning without haste
steps she went quickly to the sick man’s bedside
he had not to turn his head

“We have met
never thought I was to be your sister?”

“You would not have recognized me?” he said
her entrance.

“Yes
that Kostya has not mentioned you

But the sick man’s interest did not last long.

Before she had finished speaking
stern

“I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here
away from his fixed stare
about another room
nearer.”


Chapter 18

Levin could not look calmly at his brother; he could not himself be
natural and calm in his presence. When he went in to the sick man
eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed
and did not distinguish the details of his brother’s position. He smelt
the awful odor

convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother’s life or
to relieve his suffering. But a sense of his regarding all aid as out
of the question was felt by the sick man
made it still more painful for Levin. To be in the sick-room was agony
to him

But Kitty thought

at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her
husband
and to remedy them. And since she had not the slightest doubt that it
was her duty to help him
and immediately set to work. The very details
which reduced her husband to terror
She sent for the doctor

herself washed up something

There was no dust visible anywhere

No one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood. She
understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what
he needed.

“On the other side

The sick man kept his brother’s hand in his own. Levin felt that he
meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere. Levin
yielded with a sinking heart: yes

Chapter 19

“Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
revealed them unto babes.” So Levin thought about his wife as he talked
to her that evening.

Levin thought of the text
prudent.” He did not so consider himself
that he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea Mihalovna
could not help knowing that when he thought of death
all the force of his intellect. He knew too that the brains of many
great men
knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and Agafea Mihalovna knew
about it. Different as those two women were

lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to
deal with the dying
men like him
obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death
absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying. If Levin had
been alone now with his brother Nikolay
with terror
known what else to do.

More than that
To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking
of death and depressing subjects—also impossible. To be silent
impossible. “If I look at him he will think I am studying him
afraid; if I don’t look at him
things. If I walk on tiptoe
ashamed.” Kitty evidently did not think of herself
think about herself: she was thinking about him because she knew

swiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle

when a man shows once and for all his value
not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments.

Everything went rapidly in her hands
all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms
a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds were made
brushes
spread.

Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat
and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly. She
arranged the brushes

They could neither of them eat

of his assertion to the contrary

he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks
he would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch
holes

“Yes
all this
came. You are such purity that....” He took her hand and did not kiss
it (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him
improper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent air
brightening eyes.

“It would have been miserable for you to be alone

“Surely there are not people there so ill?”

“Worse.”

Chapter 20

The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.
During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently. His great eyes
fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card-table covered
with a colored napkin
it was awful to Levin to see it. Levin knew that this passionate prayer
and hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life
he so loved. Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect:
he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him

possibility of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a

Levin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold

consistent with the life the sick man was praying for. During the
sacrament Levin did what he

After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better. He did

“There’s nothing wonderful in it.”

“Anyway

This self-deception was not of long duration. The sick man fell into a
quiet sleep
all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself. The
reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in
the sick man himself

At eight o’clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in
their room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly. She was
pale

Both of them ran to him. He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the
bed

“How do you feel?” Levin asked in a whisper

Marya Nikolaevna went up to him.

“You had better lie down; you’d be easier

“I shall lie down soon enough
he said sarcastically
like.”

Levin laid his brother on his back
his face
the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead
thinking deeply and intensely. Levin involuntarily thought with him of
what it was that was happening to him now
mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that
calm
clearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.

“Yes
little.” He was silent. “Right!” he pronounced all at once
reassuringly
and sighed deeply.

Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet. “They’re getting cold

For a long while
lay motionless. But he was still alive
sighed. Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain. He felt that
with no mental effort

do next; closing the dead man’s eyes

conscious of sorrow nor of loss
he had any feeling for his brother at that moment
knowledge the dying man had now that he could not have.

A long time more he sat over him so
the end did not come. The door opened and Kitty appeared. Levin got up
to stop her. But at the moment he was getting up
of the dying man stirring.

“Don’t go away

lived in a house of his own. He longed for food and for sleep. He
cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet. The feet were cold
but the sick man was still breathing. Levin tried again to move away on
tiptoe

The dawn came; the sick man’s condition was unchanged. Levin stealthily
withdrew his hand
his own room and went to sleep. When he woke up
brother’s death which he expected
returned to his earlier condition. He had begun sitting up again

The sick man was suffering more and more

possible way to relieve him
Levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally
though she would not admit it. The sense of death
evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent
for his brother

The sick man said nothing.

“What am I to write to him?” said Levin. “I hope you are not angry with
him?”

“No
to send me a doctor.”

Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same
condition. The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now
at the mere sight of him

and Levin and Kitty. The sick man alone did not express this feeling

allow themselves to move freely

desire to be rid of it.

There was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him
look upon death as the goal of his desires
individual desire

pleasure. But now no physical craving or suffering received relief
the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering. And so all
desires were merged in one—the desire to be rid of all his sufferings

the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied. “Turn me

Chapter 21

From the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his
interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was
expected of him was to leave his wife in peace
with his presence
distraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not
know himself what he wanted now
those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs
everything with unqualified assent. It was only when Anna had left his
house
dine with him or separately
comprehended his position
all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect
and reconcile his past with what was now. It was not the past when he
had lived happily with his wife that troubled him. The transition from
that past to a knowledge of his wife’s unfaithfulness he had lived
through miserably already; that state was painful
understand it. If his wife had then
unfaithfulness
would not have been in the hopeless position—incomprehensible to
himself—in which he felt himself now. He could not now reconcile his
immediate past
other man’s child with what was now the case
that
put to shame
everyone.

For the first two days after his wife’s departure Alexey Alexandrovitch
received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary

Without giving himself a reason for what he was doing
every nerve of his being for those two days
appearance of composure
about the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna’s rooms and belongings
exercised immense self-control to appear like a man in whose eyes what
had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of
events
signs of despair. But on the second day after her departure
Korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper’s shop
forgotten to pay
waiting

“Excuse me
direct us to apply to her excellency
with her address?”

Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered
once
into his hands
attempted to speak and stopped short. Korney
emotion
Alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the
line of firmness and composure any longer. He gave orders for the
carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back
admitted

He felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and
exasperation
of Korney
those two days. He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the
hatred of men
that case he could have tried to be better)
shamefully and repulsively unhappy. He knew that for this
fact that his heart was torn with grief
him. He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog
yelping with pain. He knew that his sole means of security against
people was to hide his wounds from them
do this for two days
unequal struggle.

His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was
utterly alone in his sorrow. In all Petersburg there was not a human
being to whom he could express what he was feeling
him
a suffering man; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world.

Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan. There were two brothers. They
did not remember their father
Alexandrovitch was ten years old. The property was a small one. Their
uncle
favorite of the late Tsar

On completing his high school and university courses with medals
Alexey Alexandrovitch had
a prominent position in the service
devoted himself exclusively to political ambition. In the high school
and the university
Alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone. His
brother had been the person nearest to his heart
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
died shortly after Alexey Alexandrovitch’s marriage.

While he was governor of a province
lady
governor—with her niece
position that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town.
Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation. There were at the
time as many reasons for the step as against it
overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of
abstaining when in doubt. But Anna’s aunt had through a common
acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl
that he was in honor bound to make her an offer. He made the offer
concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he
was capable.

The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of
intimate relations with others. And now among all his acquaintances he
had not one friend. He had plenty of so-called connections
friendships. Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could
invite to dinner
affair he was concerned about
anyone he wished to help
people’s business and affairs of state. But his relations with these
people were confined to one clearly defined channel
routine from which it was impossible to depart. There was one man
comrade of his at the university
and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this
friend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of
Russia. Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible
were his chief secretary and his doctor.

Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin
straightforward
Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill. But their
five years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier
between them that cut off warmer relations.

After signing the papers brought him
a long while in silence
times he attempted to speak
phrase: “You have heard of my trouble?” But he ended by saying
usual: “So you’ll get this ready for me?” and with that dismissed him.

The other person was the doctor
but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that
both were weighed down by work

Of his women friends
Alexey Alexandrovitch never thought. All women
terrible and distasteful to him.


Chapter 22

Alexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna
she had not forgotten him. At the bitterest moment of his lonely
despair she came to him
straight into his study. She found him as he was sitting with his head
in both hands.

“_J’ai forcé la consigne_
breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise. “I have heard all!
Alexey Alexandrovitch! Dear friend!” she went on
hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his.

Alexey Alexandrovitch
moved her a chair.

“Won’t you sit down

“Dear friend!” repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna
off his
describing a triangle on her forehead
still uglier
and was preparing to cry. And he too was softened; he snatched her
plump hand and proceeded to kiss it.

“Dear friend!” she said in a voice breaking with emotion. “You ought
not to give way to grief. Your sorrow is a great one

with the look of ecstasy Alexey Alexandrovitch knew so well. “He will
be your support and your succor.”

Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion
at her own lofty feelings
lately gained ground in Petersburg

this now.

“I am weak. I am crushed. I foresaw nothing
nothing.”

Silently and gratefully Alexey Alexandrovitch pressed her hand.

Alexey Alexandrovitch listened to her now
had seemed to him
to him natural and consolatory. Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this
new enthusiastic fervor. He was a believer

ventured upon several new interpretations

He had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this
new doctrine

Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her friend’s hands.

“Now I will enter upon my duties
as she wiped away the traces of tears. “I am going to Seryozha. Only in
the last extremity shall I apply to you.” And she got up and went out.

Countess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seryozha’s part of the house
dropping tears on the scared child’s cheeks
father was a saint and his mother was dead.

Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise. She did actually take upon
herself the care of the organization and management of Alexey
Alexandrovitch’s household. But she had not overstated the case when
saying that practical affairs were not her strong point. All her
arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out
and they were modified by Korney
though no one was aware of the fact
and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing
all it was necessary for him to know. But Lidia Ivanovna’s help was
none the less real; she gave Alexey Alexandrovitch moral support in the
consciousness of her love and respect for him
was soothing to her to believe
Christianity—that is
turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new
interpretation of Christian doctrine
late in Petersburg. It was easy for Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in
this teaching. Alexey Alexandrovitch
others who shared their views
imagination
evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in
harmony with other conceptions
impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death

It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of
his faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch
that when

was a necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him
in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint
from which
he clung


Chapter 23

The Countess Lidia Ivanovna had
been married to a wealthy man of high rank
jovial
husband abandoned her
he met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the
count’s good heart
were at a loss to explain. Though they were divorced and lived apart
yet whenever the husband met the wife
with the same malignant irony

Countess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with her
husband
someone. She was in love with several people at once
women; she had been in love with almost everyone who had been
particularly distinguished in any way. She was in love with all the new
princes and princesses who married into the imperial family; she had
been in love with a high dignitary of the Church
priest; she had been in love with a journalist
Komissarov
Karenin. All these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent
did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated
relations with the court and fashionable society. But from the time
that after Karenin’s trouble she took him under her special protection
from the time that she set to work in Karenin’s household looking after
his welfare
thing
Karenin. The feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger
than any of her former feelings. Analyzing her feeling

in reveries on what might have been
had been free. She blushed with emotion when he came into the room
could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to
her.

For several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state of
intense excitement. She had learned that Anna and Vronsky were in
Petersburg. Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her
must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman
was in the same town with him

Lidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those
_infamous people_
she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those
days that he could not come across them. The young adjutant
acquaintance of Vronsky
who hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession
her that they had finished their business and were going away next day.
Lidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down
note was brought her
horror. It was the handwriting of Anna Karenina. The envelope was of
paper as thick as bark; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge
monogram

“Who brought it?”

“A commissionaire from the hotel.”

It was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down to read
the letter. Her excitement brought on an attack of asthma
was subject. When she had recovered her composure
following letter in French:





“Madame la Comtesse

“The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the
feel
separated from my son. I entreat permission to see him once before my
departure. Forgive me for recalling myself to your memory. I apply to
you and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch
cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me. Knowing your
friendship for him
Seryozha to me
will you let me know when and where I could see him away from home? I
do not anticipate a refusal
it rests. You cannot conceive the craving I have to see him
cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me.

“Anna”



Everything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: its
contents and the allusion to magnanimity
easy—as she considered—tone.

“Say that there is no answer
immediately opening her blotting-book
Alexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o’clock at the levee.

“I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject. There we will
arrange where to meet. Best of all at my house
_as you like it_. Urgent. He lays the cross
to bear it
Countess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day
to Alexey Alexandrovitch. She enjoyed that form of communication
gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by
their personal interviews.


Chapter 24

The levee was drawing to a close. People met as they were going away
and gossiped of the latest news
changes in the positions of the higher functionaries.

“If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War

“And me among the adjutants

department. And your assistant’s Karenin.”

“Good-day

“What were you saying of Karenin?” said the prince.

“He and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.”

“I thought he had it already.”

“No. Just look at him

“Looking older

Imperial family to pass.

Thus people talked incessantly of Alexey Alexandrovitch
with him and laughing at him
member of the Imperial Council he had captured
point by point his new financial project
discourse for an instant for fear he should escape.

Almost at the same time that his wife left Alexey Alexandrovitch there
had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official—the
moment when his upward career comes to a full stop. This full stop had
arrived and everyone perceived it
was not yet aware that his career was over. Whether it was due to his
feud with Stremov
Alexey Alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits
evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at
an end. He still filled a position of consequence
commissions and committees
from whom nothing was expected. Whatever he said
was heard as though it were something long familiar
that was not needed. But Alexey Alexandrovitch was not aware of this
and
governmental activity
defects in the action of others
means for their correction. Shortly after his separation from his wife
he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure
first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the
future.

Alexey Alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless
position in the official world
this head
activity.

“He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord
how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth for the
things that are of the world

action by Scripture
ever since he had been left without a wife
projects of reform been serving the Lord more zealously than before.

The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying to get
away from him did not trouble Alexey Alexandrovitch; he gave up his
exposition only when the member of the Council
one of the Imperial family was passing

Left alone
then looked casually about him and walked towards the door

“And how strong they all are

another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the
bedchamber.

Moving forward deliberately
customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been
talking about him
Countess Lidia Ivanovna.

“Ah! Alexey Alexandrovitch!” said the little old man
light in his eyes
and was nodding with a frigid gesture
yet

“Thank you
today
_exquisite_.

That they laughed at him he was well aware
anything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now.

Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out
above her corset
Alexandrovitch smiled
towards her.

Lidia Ivanovna’s dress had cost her great pains
dresses had done of late. Her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of
that she had pursued thirty years before. Then her desire had been to
adorn herself with something
the contrary
her age and her figure
contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be
too appalling. And as far as Alexey Alexandrovitch was concerned she
succeeded
island not only of goodwill to him
of hostility and jeering that surrounded him.

Passing through rows of ironical eyes
loving glance as a plant to the sun.

“I congratulate you

Suppressing a smile of pleasure
eyes
Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his
chief sources of satisfaction

“How is our angel?” said Countess Lidia Ivanovna

“I can’t say I was quite pleased with him
raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes. “And Sitnikov is not
satisfied with him.” (Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Seryozha’s secular
education had been intrusted.) “As I have mentioned to you
sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which
ought to touch the heart of every man and every child....” Alexey
Alexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that
interested him besides the service—the education of his son.

When Alexey Alexandrovitch with Lidia Ivanovna’s help had been brought
back anew to life and activity
education of the son left on his hands. Having never before taken any
interest in educational questions
time to the theoretical study of the subject. After reading several
books on anthropology
drew up a plan of education
to superintend it
him.

“Yes

“Yes

“You’re coming to me
have to speak of a subject painful for you. I would give anything to
have spared you certain memories
I have received a letter from _her_. _She_ is here in Petersburg.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife
immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed
utter helplessness in the matter.

“I was expecting it

Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically
rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes.


Chapter 25

When Alexey Alexandrovitch came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s snug
little boudoir
lady herself had not yet made her appearance.

She was changing her dress.

A cloth was laid on a round table
and a silver spirit-lamp and tea kettle. Alexey Alexandrovitch looked
idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room
and sitting down to the table
The rustle of the countess’s silk skirt drew his attention off.

“Well now
hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa
talk over our tea.”

After some words of preparation
hard and flushing crimson
letter she had received.

After reading the letter

“I don’t think I have the right to refuse her
lifting his eyes.

“Dear friend

“On the contrary

His face showed irresolution
guidance in a matter he did not understand.

“No
everything. I can understand immorality
truthfully
immorality; “but I don’t understand cruelty: to whom? to you! How can
she stay in the town where you are? No
one learns. And I’m learning to understand your loftiness and her
baseness.”

“Who is to throw a stone?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch
pleased with the part he had to play. “I have forgiven all
cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her—by her love for
her son....”

“But is that love
forgiven—that you forgive—have we the right to work on the feelings of
that angel? He looks on her as dead. He prays for her
God to have mercy on her sins. And it is better so. But now what will
he think?”

“I had not thought of that
agreeing.

Countess Lidia Ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent. She
was praying.

“If you ask my advice
uncovered her face
don’t see how you are suffering
But supposing that
lead to?—to fresh suffering for you
were a trace of humanity left in her
herself. No
will intrust it to me

And Alexey Alexandrovitch consented
the following letter in French:





“Dear Madame

“To be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to
questions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in
the child’s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him
sacred
the spirit of Christian love. I pray to Almighty God to have mercy on
you.

“Countess Lidia”




This letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna
had concealed from herself. It wounded Anna to the quick.

For his part
Ivanovna’s
pursuits
which he had felt of late.

The thought of his wife
towards whom he had been so saintly
justly told him
he could not understand the book he was reading; he could not drive
away harassing recollections of his relations with her
which
how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from
the races (especially that he had insisted only on the observance of
external decorum
remorse. He was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had
written her; and most of all
his care of the other man’s child made his heart burn with shame and
remorse.

And just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now
reviewed all his past with her
after long wavering

“But how have I been to blame?” he said to himself. And this question
always excited another question in him—whether they felt differently
did their loving and marrying differently
... these gentlemen of the bedchamber
there passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome
vigorous
inquisitive attention in spite of himself. He tried to dispel these
thoughts
transient life
and love in his heart.

But the fact that he had in this transient
seemed to him
eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence. But this
temptation did not last long
more in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s soul the peace and the elevation by
virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember.

today? Did papa see him?”

“He saw him. The minute the chief secretary came out

“Seryozha!” said the tutor

Since then Seryozha
great interest in him.

“Well

“Glad? I should think so! Almost dancing as he walked away.”

“And has anything been left?” asked Seryozha

“Come

Seryozha understood at once that what the hall-porter was speaking of
was a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his birthday.

“What do you say? Where?”

“Korney took it to your papa. A fine plaything it must be too!”

“How big? Like this?”

“Rather small

“A book.”

“No
said the porter
taking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off
he signed with his head towards the tutor.

“Vassily Lukitch
and loving smile which always won over the conscientious Vassily
Lukitch.

Seryozha was too happy
able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune
of which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from Lidia
Ivanovna’s niece. This piece of good news seemed to him particularly
important from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the
bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him. It
seemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be
glad and happy.

“You know papa’s received the Alexander Nevsky today?”

“To be sure I do! People have been already to congratulate him.”

“And is he glad?”

“Glad at the Tsar’s gracious favor! I should think so! It’s a proof
he’s deserved it

Seryozha fell to dreaming
he had thoroughly studied in every detail
hung down between the gray whiskers
who saw him only from below.

“Well

Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the

“Well

“I don’t know.”

His meditations were of the most complex and diverse character. He
imagined his father’s having suddenly been presented with both the
Vladimir and the Andrey today

They would make a higher one still
too.

The time passed in such meditations

ready
Seryozha. He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the
lesson; however much he tried
long as the teacher was explaining to him
to comprehend
unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word
“suddenly” is an adverb of manner of action. Still he was sorry that he
had disappointed the teacher.

He chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.

“Mihail Ivanitch

“You’d much better be thinking about your work. Birthdays are of no
importance to a rational being. It’s a day like any other on which one
has to do one’s work.”

Seryozha looked intently at the teacher
spectacles
fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher
was explaining to him. He knew that the teacher did not think what he
said; he felt it from the tone in which it was said. “But why have they
all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and
most useless stuff? Why does he keep me off; why doesn’t he love me?”
he asked himself mournfully


Chapter 27

After the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father’s lesson.
While waiting for his father
penknife
was searching for his mother during his walks. He did not believe in
death generally
Ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed
because of that
begun looking for her when out for a walk. Every woman of full
graceful figure with dark hair was his mother. At the sight of such a
woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his
breath failed him

cry with happiness
she tickled him
fingers. Later
his mother was not dead
explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which
he could not possibly believe

gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil
a throbbing heart
along the path. The lady had not come up to them
somewhere. That day
love for her
and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife
straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her.

“Here is your papa!” said Vassily Lukitch

Seryozha jumped up and went up to his father
looked at him intently
receiving the Alexander Nevsky.

“Did you have a nice walk?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch
his easy chair
opening it. Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told
Seryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history
thoroughly
and Seryozha observed this.

“Yes
on his chair and rocking it
(Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna’s who was being brought up in
her house). “She told me you’d been given a new star. Are you glad
papa?”

“First of all
Alexandrovitch. “And secondly
the work itself. And I could have wished you understood that. If you
now are going to work
will seem hard to you; but when you work” (Alexey Alexandrovitch
spoke
the wearisome labor of the morning
and eighty papers)
it.”

Seryozha’s eyes
dull and dropped before his father’s gaze. This was the same
long-familiar tone his father always took with him
learned by now to fall in with it. His father always talked to him—so
Seryozha felt—as though he were addressing some boy of his own
imagination
himself. And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being the
story-book boy.

“You understand that

“Yes

The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the
Gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament. The
verses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well
when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply
protruding
thread
another. So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not
understand what he was saying

He frowned
before and never could remember
just as that “suddenly” is an adverb of manner of action. Seryozha
looked with scared eyes at his father
whether his father would make him repeat what he had said
sometimes did. And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he now
understood nothing. But his father did not make him repeat it
passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament. Seryozha recounted
the events themselves well enough
as to what certain events prefigured

before the Flood. He did not know one of them

but now he had forgotten them utterly

of thought

button on his waistcoat.

In death
entirely. He did not believe that those he loved could die
that he himself would die. That was to him something utterly
inconceivable and impossible. But he had been told that all men die; he
had asked people
it; his old nurse
had not died
cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?” thought
Seryozha. Bad people
die

“Well

“Enoch

“But you have said that already. This is bad
you don’t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a
Christian

important of his teachers) “is displeased with you.... I shall have to
punish you.”

His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha
certainly did learn his lessons very badly. But still it could not be
said he was a stupid boy. On the contrary
boys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha. In his father’s
opinion
could not learn that. He could not

made upon him. Those claims were in opposition
conflict with his education. He was nine years old; he was a child; but
he knew his own soul

his soul. His teachers complained that he would not learn
soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge. And he learned from
Kapitonitch
not from his teachers. The spring his father and his teachers reckoned
upon to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source
waters did their work in another channel.

His father punished Seryozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka
Lidia Ivanovna’s niece; but this punishment turned out happily for
Seryozha. Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor
make windmills. The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming
how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself—clutching at the
sails or tying himself on and whirling round. Of his mother Seryozha

On arriving in Petersburg
hotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story
nurse

On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother’s. There he found
his mother
sister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay
abroad
a single word in allusion to his connection with Anna. His brother came
the next morning to see Vronsky
her
connection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a
divorce
much a wife as any other wife
and his wife so.

“If the world disapproves
relations want to be on terms of relationship with me
to be on the same terms with my wife.”

The elder brother
judgment
world had decided the question; for his part he had nothing against it
and with Alexey he went up to see Anna.

Before his brother
certain formality
it was understood that his brother knew their real relations
talked about Anna’s going to Vronsky’s estate.

In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was
the new position in which he was placed
misapprehension. One would have thought he must have understood that
society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had
sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned
days
unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the
views of society had changed
be received in society was not a foregone conclusion. “Of course
thought
and must look at it in the proper light.” One may sit for several hours
at a stretch with one’s legs crossed in the same position
that there’s nothing to prevent one’s changing one’s position; but if a
man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs
come on
which one would like to draw them. This was what Vronsky was
experiencing in regard to the world. Though at the bottom of his heart
he knew that the world was shut on them
the world had not changed by now and would not receive them. But he
very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him
personally
mouse

One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his
cousin Betsy.

“At last!” she greeted him joyfully. “And Anna? How glad I am! Where
are you stopping? I can fancy after your delightful travels you must
find our poor Petersburg horrid. I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.
How about the divorce? Is that all over?”

Vronsky noticed that Betsy’s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no
divorce had as yet taken place.

“People will throw stones at me
and see Anna; yes
suppose?”

And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day
not at all the same as in former days. She unmistakably prided herself
on her courage
friendship. She only stayed ten minutes
on leaving she said:

“You’ve never told me when the divorce is to be? Supposing I’m ready to
fling my cap over the mill
shoulder until you’re married. And that’s so simple nowadays. _Ça se
fait_. So you’re going on Friday? Sorry we shan’t see each other
again.”

From Betsy’s tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from
the world; but he made another effort in his own family. His mother he
did not reckon upon. He knew that his mother
enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance
on her now for having ruined her son’s career. But he had more hope of
Varya
would go simply and directly to see Anna
own house.

The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her
expressed his wishes directly.

“You know
and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken
because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna
said
“Don’t suppose
should have done the same. I don’t and can’t enter into that
said
their names. You want me to go and see her
rehabilitate her in society; but do understand that _I cannot_ do so. I
have daughters growing up
husband’s sake. Well
will understand that I can’t ask her here
such a way that she would not meet people who look at things
differently; that would offend her. I can’t raise her....”

“Oh
receive!” Vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily
silence
shaken.

“Alexey! don’t be angry with me. Please understand that I’m not to
blame

“I’m not angry with you
two ways. I’m sorry
not breaking up
me

And with that he left her.

Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless
spend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town
avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to
be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable
to him. One of the most unpleasant features of his position in
Petersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet
him everywhere. He could not begin to talk of anything without the
conversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere
without risk of meeting him. So at least it seemed to Vronsky
it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually
on purpose

Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he
perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand
in Anna. At one time she would seem in love with him
would become cold
something
notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence
her delicate intuition


Chapter 29

One of Anna’s objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her son.
From the day she left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to
agitate her. And as she got nearer to Petersburg
importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination. She
did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it. It seemed
to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same
town with him. But on her arrival in Petersburg she was suddenly made
distinctly aware of her present position in society
the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter.

She had now been two days in Petersburg. The thought of her son never
left her for a single instant
straight to the house
she felt she had no right to do. She might be refused admittance and
insulted. To write and so enter into relations with her husband—that it
made her miserable to think of doing; she could only be at peace when
she did not think of her husband. To get a glimpse of her son out
walking
her; she had so looked forward to this meeting
must say to him
old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do. But the nurse
was not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s house. In this
uncertainty

Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and
Countess Lidia Ivanovna
a letter
said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband’s
generosity. She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband
would keep up his character of magnanimity
request.

The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most
cruel and unexpected answer
felt so humiliated as at the moment when

Countess Lidia Ivanovna was right. Her suffering was the more poignant
that she had to bear it in solitude. She could not and would not share
it with Vronsky. She knew that to him
cause of her distress
matter of very little consequence. She knew that he would never be
capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering
cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him. And she
dreaded that more than anything in the world
everything that related to her son. Spending the whole day at home she
considered ways of seeing her son
to her husband. She was just composing this letter when she was handed
the letter from Lidia Ivanovna. The countess’s silence had subdued and
depressed her

“This coldness—this pretense of feeling!” she said to herself. “They

deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child.

She went to a toy shop
She would go early in the morning at eight o’clock
Alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up. She would have money in
her hand to give the hall-porter and the footman
let her in
from Seryozha’s godfather to congratulate him
charged to leave the toys at his bedside. She had prepared everything
but the words she should say to her son. Often as she had dreamed of
it

The next day

“Seryozha—Sergey Alexeitch

“Whom do you want?” he asked.

She did not hear his words and made no answer.

Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady

to want.

“From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch

“His honor’s not up yet

Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the
house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her.
Memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart
a moment she forgot what she was here for.

“Would you kindly wait?” said Kapitonitch

As he took off the cloak
her

“Please walk in

She tried to say something
with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light
swift steps up the stairs. Bent double
the steps

“The tutor’s there; maybe he’s not dressed. I’ll let him know.”

Anna still mounted the familiar staircase

stood still waiting. “He’s only just awake
coming out. And at the very instant the porter said this
the sound of a childish yawn. From the sound of this yawn alone she
knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes.

“Let me in; go away!” she said
On the right of the door stood a bed
boy. His little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned
was stretching and still yawning. The instant his lips came together
they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile
slowly and deliciously rolled back again.

“Seryozha!” she whispered

When she was parted from him
been feeling a fresh rush of love for him

not even the same as when she had left him; he was still further from
the four-year-old baby
how short his hair was! What long hands! How he had changed since she
left him! But it was he with his head
broad little shoulders.

“Seryozha!” she repeated just in the child’s ear.

He raised himself again on his elbow
to side as though looking for something
and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing
motionless before him
shutting his eyes

“Seryozha! my darling boy!” she said
arms round his plump little body. “Mother!” he said
her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him.

Smiling sleepily still with closed eyes
her shoulders

against her neck and shoulders.

“I know
you’d come. I’ll get up directly.”

And saying that he dropped asleep.

Anna looked at him hungrily; she saw how he had grown and changed in
her absence. She knew
that were thrust out below the quilt
neck in which she had so often kissed him. She touched all this and
could say nothing; tears choked her.

“What are you crying for
“Mother

“I won’t cry ... I’m crying for joy. It’s so long since I’ve seen you.
I won’t
“Come

where his clothes were put ready for him.

“How do you dress without me? How....” she tried to begin talking
simply and cheerfully

“I don’t have a cold bath

And Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter. She looked at him and
smiled.

“Mother

fully grasped what had happened.

“I don’t want that on
seeing her afresh without her hat

“But what did you think about me? You didn’t think I was dead?”

“I never believed it.”

“You didn’t believe it

But the embraces of the mother and child
and what they were saying

He shook his head
another ten minutes
wiping away tears.

Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all
this time. All had heard that their mistress had come

o’clock

“A pretty business
Vassilievitch
I’ll run and get her away somehow. A pretty business!”

When the nurse went into the nursery
how he and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill
over three times. She was listening to the sound of his voice

did not follow what he was saying. She must go

The nurse suddenly burst into tears

Seryozha
and his nurse by the other
bare feet. The tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother
threw him into an ecstasy.

“Mother! She often comes to see me
beginning
in a whisper to his mother
look of dread and something like shame
unbecoming to her.

She went up to him.

“My sweet!” she said.

She could not say _good-bye_
and he understood. “Darling
which she had called him when he was little
You....” but she could not say more.

How often afterwards she thought of words she might have said. But now
she did not know how to say it
knew all she wanted to say to him. He understood that she was unhappy
and loved him. He understood even what the nurse had whispered. He had
caught the words “always at nine o’clock
said of his father
he understood
be a look of dread and shame in her face?... She was not in fault
she was afraid of him and ashamed of something. He would have liked to
put a question that would have set at rest this doubt

The mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking

At that moment the door opened. Vassily Lukitch came in.

At the other door there was the sound of steps

As intensely as Anna had longed to see her son
been thinking of it and preparing herself for it
least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply. On getting
back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while
understand why she was there. “Yes

almost a personality
a conflict of thought and feeling; he understood her

forever—not physically only but spiritually—divided from him
was impossible to set this right.

She gave the baby back to the nurse
in which there was Seryozha’s portrait when he was almost of the same
age as the girl. She got up
little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at
different ages. She wanted to compare them
of the album. She took them all out except one
photograph. In it he was in a white smock
with frowning eyes and smiling lips. It was his best
characteristic expression. With her little supple hands
delicate fingers
pulled at a corner of the photograph
somewhere

son’s (it was a photograph of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and
with long hair)
here is he!” she said
suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery. She had
not once thought of him all the morning. But now
upon that manly
sudden rush of love for him.

“But where is he? How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?” she
thought all at once with a feeling of reproach
herself kept from him everything concerning her son. She sent to ask
him to come to her immediately; with a throbbing heart she awaited him
rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all
the expressions of love with which he would console her. The messenger
returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him
would come immediately
bring with him Prince Yashvin
“He’s not coming alone
she thought; “he’s not coming so that I could tell him everything
coming with Yashvin.” And all at once a strange idea came to her: what
if he had ceased to love her?

And going over the events of the last few days
she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea. The fact
that he had not dined at home yesterday
insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg
even now he was not coming to her alone
avoid meeting her face to face.

“But he ought to tell me so. I must know that it is so. If I knew it
then I know what I should do
picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced
of his not caring for her. She thought he had ceased to love her

She rang for her maid and went to her dressing-room. As she dressed
she took more care over her appearance than she had done all those
days
with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way
most becoming to her.

She heard the bell ring before she was ready. When she went into the

When Vronsky returned home

was going
had been going about somewhere without a word to him—all this
with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning
recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before Yashvin
almost snatched her son’s photographs out of his hands
serious. He decided he absolutely must speak openly with her. And he
waited for her in her drawing-room. But Anna did not return alone
brought with her her old unmarried aunt
the lady who had come in the morning
shopping. Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky’s worried and inquiring
expression
saw that there was something working within her; in her flashing eyes
when they rested for a moment on him
concentration
rapidity and grace which
had so fascinated him

The dinner was laid for four. All were gathered together and about to
go into the little dining-room when Tushkevitch made his appearance
with a message from Princess Betsy. Princess Betsy begged her to excuse
her not having come to say good-bye; she had been indisposed
begged Anna to come to her between half-past six and nine o’clock.
Vronsky glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time
steps having been taken that she should meet no one; but Anna appeared
not to notice it.

“Very sorry that I can’t come just between half-past six and nine
said with a faint smile.

“The princess will be very sorry.”

“And so am I.”

“You’re going

“Patti? You suggest the idea to me. I would go if it were possible to
get a box.”

“I can get one

“I should be very

Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug. He was at a complete loss to
understand what Anna was about. What had she brought the old Princess
Oblonskaya home for
and
possibly think in her position of going to Patti’s benefit
the circle of her acquaintances would be? He looked at her with serious
eyes
half-desperate look
dinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits—she almost flirted both
with Tushkevitch and with Yashvin. When they got up from dinner and
Tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera
and Vronsky went down with him to his own rooms. After sitting there
for some time he ran upstairs. Anna was already dressed in a low-necked
gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris
costly white lace on her head
becoming

“Are you really going to the theater?” he said
her.

“Why do you ask with such alarm?” she said
looking at her. “Why shouldn’t I go?”

She appeared not to understand the motive of his words.

“Oh

“That’s just what I say

“Anna
to her exactly as once her husband had done.

“I don’t understand what you are asking.”

“You know that it’s out of the question to go.”

“Why so? I’m not going alone. Princess Varvara has gone to dress
is going with me.”

He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair.

“But do you mean to say you don’t know?...” he began.

“But I don’t care to know!” she almost shrieked. “I don’t care to. Do I
regret what I have done? No

is only one thing that matters

He looked at her. He saw all the beauty of her face and full dress
always so becoming to her. But now her beauty and elegance were just
what irritated him.

“My feeling cannot change
said again in French
but with coldness in his eyes.

She did not hear his words
answered with irritation:

“And I beg you to explain why I should not go.”

“Because it might cause you....” he hesitated.

“I don’t understand. Yashvin _n’est pas compromettant_

Chapter 33

Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna
almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own
position. This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her
plainly the cause of his anger. If he had told her directly what he was
thinking

“In that dress
show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging
your position as a fallen woman
society

He could not say that to her. “But how can she fail to see it
is going on in her?” he said to himself. He felt at the same time that
his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was
intensified.

He went back scowling to his rooms

With that gesture he knocked against the table
standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy
it. He tried to catch it
over and rang.

“If you care to be in my service
“you had better remember your duties. This shouldn’t be here. You ought
to have cleared away.”

The valet
but glancing at his master
do was to be silent
dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken
glasses and bottles.

“That’s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away
coat out.”

Vronsky went into the theater at half-past eight. The performance was
in full swing. The little old box-keeper
helped him off with his fur coat
suggested he should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor. In
the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and
two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors.
Through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet _staccato_
accompaniment of the orchestra
distinctly a musical phrase. The door opened to let the box-opener slip
through
clearly. But the doors were closed again at once
hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment
he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over. When he entered
the hall
was still going on. On the stage the singer
bare shoulders flashing with diamonds
who had given her his arm
awkwardly over the footlights. Then she went up to a gentleman with
glossy pomaded hair parted down the center
the footlights holding out something to her
stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement
shouting and clapping. The conductor in his high chair assisted in
passing the offering
into the middle of the stalls
him. That day less than ever was his attention turned upon the
familiar
familiar
theater.

There were
some sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed women—God
knows who—and uniforms and black coats; the same dirty crowd in the
upper gallery; and among the crowd
were some forty of the _real_ people. And to those oases Vronsky at
once directed his attention
relation.

The act was over when he went in
brother’s box
footlights with Serpuhovskoy
his heel on the footlights
beckoned to him

Vronsky had not yet seen Anna. He purposely avoided looking in her
direction. But he knew by the direction of people’s eyes where she was.
He looked round discreetly
worst
Alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening.

“How little of the military man there is left in you!” Serpuhovskoy was
saying to him. “A diplomat
would say.”

“Yes
Vronsky

“Well
on this

Serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky’s career
liked him as before

“What a pity you were not in time for the first act!”

Vronsky
and scanned the boxes. Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man
seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera-glass
caught sight of Anna’s head
in the frame of lace. She was in the fifth box
She was sitting in front
Yashvin. The setting of her head on her handsome
the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face
reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow. But
he felt utterly different towards her beauty now. In his feeling for
her now there was no element of mystery
attracted him even more intensely than before
injury. She was not looking in his direction
had seen him already.

When Vronsky turned the opera-glass again in that direction
that Princess Varvara was particularly red
unnaturally and looking round at the next box. Anna
and tapping it on the red velvet
obviously did not wish to see
Yashvin’s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing
at cards. Scowling
further into his mouth

In that box on the left were the Kartasovs. Vronsky knew them
that Anna was acquainted with them. Madame Kartasova
woman
was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her. Her face
was pale and angry
bald man
soothe his wife. When the wife had gone out
long while
her. But Anna
talked to Yashvin
went out without making his salutation

Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the
Kartasovs and Anna
happened. He knew this both from what he had seen
the face of Anna
through the part she had taken up. And in maintaining this attitude of
external composure she was completely successful. Anyone who did not
know her and her circle
women expressive of commiseration
should show herself in society
her lace and her beauty
of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the
sensations of a man in the stocks.

Knowing that something had happened
Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety
something
way round furthest from Anna’s box
the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances. Vronsky
heard the name of Madame Karenina
to address Vronsky loudly by name
companions.

“Ah
without a supper. You’re one of the old set
regiment.

“I can’t stop
upstairs towards his brother’s box.

The old countess
his brother’s box. Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him in
the corridor.

Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother
to her brother-in-law
interested him. She was more excited than he had ever seen her.

“I think it’s mean and hateful
it. Madame Karenina....” she began.

“But what is it? I don’t know.”

“What? you’ve not heard?”

“You know I should be the last person to hear of it.”

“There isn’t a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova!”

“But what did she do?”

“My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina. Her husband
began talking to her across the box
She said something aloud

“Count
Sorokina

“I’ve been expecting you all the while
sarcastically. “You were nowhere to be seen.”

Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight.

“Good evening

“Why aren’t you going to _faire la cour à Madame Karenina?_” she went
on
oublie la Patti pour elle_.”

“Maman
answered

“I’m only saying what everyone’s saying.”

Vronsky made no reply
went away. At the door he met his brother.

“Ah
nothing else.... I wanted to go straight to her. Let’s go together.”

Vronsky did not hear him. With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt
that he must do something
having put herself and him in such a false position
for her suffering
for Anna’s box. At her box stood Stremov

“There are no more tenors. _Le moule en est brisé!_”

Vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov.

“You came in late
to Vronsky

“I am a poor judge of music

“Like Prince Yashvin
sings too loud.”

“Thank you
playbill Vronsky picked up
face quivered. She got up and went into the interior of the box.

Noticing in the next act that her box was empty
indignant “hushes” in the silent audience
solo and drove home.

Anna was already at home. When Vronsky went up to her
same dress as she had worn at the theater. She was sitting in the first
armchair against the wall
him

“Anna

“You
despair and hatred in her voice

“I begged

“Unpleasant!” she cried—“hideous! As long as I live I shall never
forget it. She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.”

“A silly woman’s chatter

“I hate your calm. You ought not to have brought me to this. If you had
loved me....”

“Anna! How does the question of my love come in?”

“Oh
said

He was sorry for her
love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her
he did not reproach her in words

And the asseverations of his love
he was ashamed to utter them
became calmer. The next day

PART SIX


Chapter 1

Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe
her sister Kitty Levin’s. The house on her own estate was quite in
ruins
with them. Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement. He
said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending
the summer in the country with his family
greatest happiness for him; and remaining in Moscow
the country from time to time for a day or two. Besides the Oblonskys
with all their children and their governess
to stay that summer with the Levins
watch over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.
Moreover
Kitty when she was married
were friends or relations of Levin’s wife. And though he liked them
all
smothered by this influx of the “Shtcherbatsky element
it to himself. Of his own relations there stayed with him only Sergey
Ivanovitch

In the Levins’ house
that almost all the rooms were occupied
happened that the old princess
over
table. And Kitty
to get all the chickens
needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.

The whole family were sitting at dinner. Dolly’s children
governess and Varenka
mushrooms. Sergey Ivanovitch
his intellect and learning
surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.

“Take me with you. I am very fond of picking mushrooms
looking at Varenka; “I think it’s a very nice occupation.”

“Oh
exchanged meaningful glances with Dolly. The proposal of the learned
and intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with
Varenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty’s with which her mind had
been very busy of late. She made haste to address some remark to her
mother
Ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window
while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother
watched the door through which the children would start on the
mushroom-picking expedition. Levin was sitting in the window near his
brother.

Kitty stood beside her husband
conversation that had no interest for her
something.

“You have changed in many respects since your marriage
better
interested in the conversation
passion for defending the most paradoxical theories.”

“Katya

“Oh
children running out.

At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways

straight up to him.

Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes
father’s fine eyes
put it on for him

“Varenka’s waiting
from Sergey Ivanovitch’s smile that she might do so.

Varenka was standing at the door
a white kerchief on her head.

“I’m coming
finishing his cup of coffee
his handkerchief and cigar-case.

“And how sweet my Varenka is! eh?” said Kitty to her husband
as Sergey Ivanovitch rose. She spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could
hear
good-looking she is—such a refined beauty! Varenka!” Kitty shouted.
“Shall you be in the mill copse? We’ll come out to you.”

“You certainly forget your condition
hurriedly coming out at the door. “You mustn’t shout like that.”

Varenka
light
flushed and eager face
common was going on in her. Kitty knew what this was
watching her intently. She called Varenka at that moment merely in
order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which
Kitty fancied
wood.

“Varenka
happen

“And are you coming with us?” Varenka said to Levin in confusion
pretending not to have heard what had been said.

“I am coming
stop.”

“Why

“I must go to have a look at the new wagons
said Levin; “and where will you be?”

“On the terrace.”


Chapter 2

On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party. They always
liked sitting there after dinner
there too. Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes
all of them were busy
by a method new to Agafea Mihalovna
Kitty had introduced this new method
home. Agafea Mihalovna
intrusted
could not be amiss
maintaining that the jam could not be made without it. She had been
caught in the act
to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made
without water.

Agafea Mihalovna
thin arms bare to the elbows
charcoal stove
they would stick and not cook properly. The princess
Agafea Mihalovna’s wrath must be chiefly directed against her
person responsible for the raspberry jam-making
absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam
matters

“I always buy my maids’ dresses myself
princess said
skim it
the slightest need for you to do it
stopping Kitty.

“I’ll do it
spoon over the frothing sugar
clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered
with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup. “How they’ll enjoy this
at tea-time!” she thought of her children
as a child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what
was best of all—the scum of the jam.

“Stiva says it’s much better to give money.” Dolly took up meanwhile
the weighty subject under discussion
servants. “But....”

“Money’s out of the question!” the princess and Kitty exclaimed with
one voice. “They appreciate a present....”

“Well
poplin

“I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.”

“A charming pattern—so simple and refined
myself
inexpensive.”

“Well
spoon.

“When it sets as it drops
Mihalovna.”

“The flies!” said Agafea Mihalovna angrily. “It’ll be just the same
she added.

“Ah! how sweet it is! don’t frighten it!” Kitty said suddenly
at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center
of a raspberry.

“Yes

“_À propos de Varenka_
been doing all the while
understand them
settled today. You know what I mean. How splendid it would be!”

“But what a famous matchmaker she is!” said Dolly. “How carefully and
cleverly she throws them together!...”

“No; tell me

“Why
at any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now
he’s not quite a young man
glad to marry him even now.... She’s a very nice girl
might....”

“Oh
better could be imagined. In the first place
Kitty

“He thinks her very attractive

“Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to
look for either fortune or position in his wife. All he needs is a
good

“Well

“Thirdly
be so splendid!... I look forward to seeing them coming out of the
forest—and everything settled. I shall see at once by their eyes. I
should be so delighted! What do you think

“But don’t excite yourself. It’s not at all the thing for you to be
excited

“Oh

“Ah
a sort of barrier
smiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“Mamma

“There was nothing out of the way
princess

“Oh
speak?”

Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother
on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a
woman’s life.

“Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.”

“But how was it settled between you

“You imagine
always just the same: it was settled by the eyes

“How nicely you said that
it’s done

“But what words did he say?”

“What did Kostya say to you?”

“He wrote it in chalk. It was wonderful.... How long ago it seems!” she
said.

And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. Kitty was the
first to break the silence. She remembered all that last winter before
her marriage

“There’s one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka’s
natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. “I should have liked
to say something to Sergey Ivanovitch
men

“Not all
miserable even now to remember Vronsky. Eh? that’s true

“Yes

“But I really don’t know
care of her daughter
him? That Vronsky paid you attentions—that happens to every girl.”

“Oh

“No
let me have a talk to Vronsky. Don’t you remember?”

“Oh

“There’s no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... Your
friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. I should
myself have called upon him to explain himself. But
not right for you to be agitated. Please remember that
yourself.”

“I’m perfectly calm

“How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then
unhappy for her. It turned out quite the opposite
her own ideas. “Then Anna was so happy
unhappy. Now it is just the opposite. I often think of her.”

“A nice person to think about! Horrid
her mother
but Levin.

“What do you want to talk of it for?” Kitty said with annoyance. “I
never think about it
want to think of it
well-known step on the steps of the terrace.

“What’s that you don’t want to think about?” inquired Levin
onto the terrace.

But no one answered him

“I’m sorry I’ve broken in on your feminine parliament
looking round on everyone discontentedly
been talking of something which they would not talk about before him.

For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea
Mihalovna
at the outside Shtcherbatsky element. He smiled
to Kitty.

“Well
with which everyone looked at her now.

“Oh
you?”

“The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did. Well
going for the children? I’ve ordered the horses to be put in.”

“What! you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?” her mother said
reproachfully.

“Yes

Levin never called the princess “maman” as men often do call their
mothers-in-law
he liked and respected the princess
without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.

“Come with us

“I don’t like to see such imprudence.”

“Well
husband and took his hand.

“You may be well

“Well
Agafea Mihalovna
new way?”

“I suppose it’s all right. For our notions it’s boiled too long.”

“It’ll be all the better
though our ice has begun to thaw already
to store it
addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling; “but your
pickle’s so good
added

Agafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.

“You needn’t try to console me
with him
familiarity of that _with him_ touched Kitty.

“Come along with us to look for mushrooms
places.” Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her head
“I should like to be angry with you too

“Do it
the jam
will never go mildewy.”


Chapter 3

Kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her
husband
over his face—always so quick to reflect every feeling—at the moment
when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of
and had got no answer.

When they had set off on foot ahead of the others
sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road
and sprinkled with grains of corn
pressed it closer to her. He had quite forgotten the momentary
unpleasant impression
of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his
mind
the being near to the woman he loved. There was no need of speech
he longed to hear the sound of her voice
changed since she had been with child. In her voice
there was that softness and gravity which is found in people
continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit.

“So you’re not tired? Lean more on me

“No
though I’m happy with them

“That was good
squeezing her hand.

“Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?”

“About jam?”

“Oh

“Ah!” said Levin
words she was saying
which passed now through the forest
might make a false step.

“And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka. You’ve noticed?... I’m very
anxious for it
peeped into his face.

“I don’t know what to think
very strange to me in that way. I told you

“Yes

“That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and
tradition. I remember him then. He was wonderfully sweet. But I’ve
watched him since with women; he is friendly
but one feels that to him they’re simply people

“Yes

“Perhaps there is.... But one has to know him.... He’s a peculiar
wonderful person. He lives a spiritual life only. He’s too pure
exalted a nature.”

“Why? Would this lower him

“No
himself with actual fact

Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly
taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language. He knew that his
wife
what he meant to say from a hint

“Yes
me. I can see that he would never have cared for me. She is altogether
spiritual.”

“Oh
like you....”

“Yes

“It’s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each
other
blame myself for not; it ends in one’s forgetting. Ah
dear he was!... Yes
pause.

“You think he can’t fall in love
language.

“It’s not so much that he can’t fall in love
“but he has not the weakness necessary.... I’ve always envied him
even now

“You envy him for not being able to fall in love?”

“I envy him for being better than I
himself. His whole life is subordinated to his duty. And that’s why he
can be calm and contented.”

“And you?” Kitty asked

She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her
smile; but the last link in it was that her husband
brother and abasing himself
this insincerity came from his love for his brother
shame at being too happy
be better—she loved it in him

“And you? What are you dissatisfied with?” she asked
smile.

Her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him
unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds
of her disbelief.

“I am happy

“Why

“Well
whatever but that you should not stumble—see? Oh
mustn’t skip about like that!” he cried
too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.
“But when I think about myself
especially with my brother

“But in what way?” Kitty pursued with the same smile. “Don’t you too
work for others? What about your co-operative settlement
on the estate

“Oh
pressing her hand—“that all that doesn’t count. I do it in a way
halfheartedly. If I could care for all that as I care for you!...
Instead of that

“Well
creature then

“He?—no! But then one must have the simplicity
straightforwardness
that. I do nothing
there was you—and _this_ too
that she understood—“I put all my energies into work; now I can’t
I’m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me
pretending....”

“Well
Ivanovitch?” said Kitty. “Would you like to do this work for the
general good
else?”

“Of course not
anything. So you think he’ll make her an offer today?” he added after a
brief silence.

“I think so
Here
the edge of the path. “Come
said

“He does

“No
watching his fingers with interest. “You picked off two.”

“Oh
tearing off a little half-grown petal. “Here’s the wagonette overtaking
us.”

“Aren’t you tired

“Not in the least.”

“If you are you can get in

But it was not worth while to get in

standing far apart
between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark
bushes of hazel. Walking some forty paces away

him. Only overhead in the birches under which he stood
a swarm of bees

tree. The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus
the light went out. At last one of the matches burned
cigar smoke
forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a
birch tree. Watching the streak of smoke
gently on

“Why not?” he thought. “If it were only a passing fancy or a passion
if it were only this attraction—this mutual attraction (I can call it a
_mutual_ attraction)
the whole bent of my life—if I felt that in giving way to this
attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it’s
not so. The only thing I can say against it is that
I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory. That’s the
only thing I can say against my feeling.... That’s a great thing
Sergey Ivanovitch said to himself
consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally
would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of
others. “But apart from that
find anything to say against my feeling. If I were choosing by
considerations of suitability alone

However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew

Another point: she was not only far from being worldly

They walked on for some steps in silence. Varenka saw that he wanted to
speak; she guessed of what
walked so far away that no one could hear them now
not begin to speak. It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.
After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they
wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms. But against her own
will

“So you found nothing? In the middle of the wood there are always

annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms. He wanted to bring her
back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but after
a pause of some length
observation in response to her last words.

“I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at

almost certain that she was in love with him. And this moment it would
have to be decided. She felt frightened. She dreaded both his speaking
and his not speaking.

Now or never it must be said—that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.
Everything in the expression
of Varenka betrayed a painful suspense. Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and
felt sorry for her. He felt even that to say nothing now would be a
slight to her. Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in
support of his decision. He even said over to himself the words in
which he meant to put his offer
utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask:

“What is the difference between the ‘birch’ mushroom and the ‘white’
mushroom?”

Varenka’s lips quivered with emotion as she answered:

“In the top part there is scarcely any difference

And as soon as these words were uttered
was over
emotion
began to subside.

“The birch mushroom’s stalk suggests a dark man’s chin after two days
without shaving

“Yes
direction of their walk changed. They began to turn towards the
children. Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she had
a sense of relief.

When he had got home again and went over the whole subject
Ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one. He
could not be false to the memory of Marie.

“Gently

children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.

Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the
wood. Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she saw from the calm and
somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.

“Well?” her husband questioned her as they were going home again.

“It doesn’t bite

“How doesn’t bite?”

“I’ll show you

“Which didn’t it bite with?” he said

Chapter 6

During the time of the children’s tea the grown-up people sat in the
balcony and talked as though nothing had happened
especially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka
there had happened an event which
importance. They both had the same feeling
schoolboy after an examination
shut him out of the school forever. Everyone present
something had happened
and Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that
evening. And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a
disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and
could not—and they felt a prick of conscience.

“Mark my words

That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by
train

“And I know why
ought to be left alone for a while at first.”

“But papa has left us alone. We’ve never seen him
“Besides

“Only if he doesn’t come
the princess

“What nonsense

“How do you suppose he is feeling? Why

And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess’s voice.
Her daughters were silent

and useful as she felt herself to be there

“What is it

“About supper.”

“Well
I’ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson
done all day.”

“That’s my lesson! No

Grisha
the term in the summer holidays. Darya Alexandrovna
studying Latin with her son in Moscow before
coming to the Levins’ to go over with him
most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic. Levin had offered to
take her place

given it

Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch

she wished. And he went on teaching Grisha
the book
of the lesson. So it had been today.

“No
properly
then we shall have to miss it.”

And Levin went to Grisha.

Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty. Even in the happy
well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making
herself useful.

“I’ll see to the supper
Agafea Mihalovna.

“Yes
ours....”

“Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it
her.

“What a nice girl!” said the princess.

“Not nice

“Yes

such a matter.

In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses
and the sound of wheels on the gravel. Dolly had not time to get up to
go and meet her husband
Grisha was having his lesson
after him.

“It’s Stiva!” Levin shouted from under the balcony. “We’ve finished

“_Is ea id

“And someone else too! Papa
entrance of the avenue. “Kitty
round.”

But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the
carriage for the old prince. As he got nearer to the carriage he saw
beside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome
man in a Scotch cap
Veslovsky
gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society. “A capital fellow
keen sportsman

Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in
place of the old prince

Levin did not get into the carriage

still more uncongenial and superfluous when
where the whole party

and gallant air

looked darkly at everyone

“Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?” he thought
at Stepan Arkadyevitch’s tender demonstrations to his wife. He looked
at Dolly

“She doesn’t believe in his love. So what is she so pleased about?
Revolting!” thought Levin.

He looked at the princess
and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka
with his ribbons

Even Sergey Ivanovitch
him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan
Arkadyevitch

And Varenka

thinking of nothing but getting married.

And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of
gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country
though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else. And
unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his
smile.

Noisily talking
all seated

Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband. She tried to seize a
moment to speak to him alone
saying he was wanted at the counting-house. It was long since his own
work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.
“It’s all holiday for them

Chapter 7

Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to
supper. On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna
consulting about wines for supper.

“But why are you making all this fuss? Have what we usually do.”

“No

general conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka
Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“Well
Arkadyevitch.

“Please
he sat down sideways

“I shall be delighted
this year?” said Levin to Veslovsky
speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him
and that was so out of keeping with him. “I can’t answer for our
finding grouse
early. You’re not tired? Aren’t you tired

“Me tired? I’ve never been tired yet. Suppose we stay up all night.
Let’s go for a walk!”

“Yes

thinking

“No
her side behind the table where they were having supper. “I’ve so much
still to tell you.”

“Nothing really

“Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna’s
again? You know they’re hardly fifty miles from you
certainly go over there. Veslovsky

Vassenka crossed over to the ladies

“Ah
Alexandrovna appealed to him.

Levin was left at the other end of the table
in his conversation with the princess and Varenka
was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan
Arkadyevitch
on his wife’s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with
fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka
something with great animation.

“It’s exceedingly nice at their place
about Vronsky and Anna. “I can’t
judge

“What do they intend doing?”

“I believe they think of going to Moscow.”

“How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together! When are
you going there?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.

“I’m spending July there.”

“Will you go?” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.

“I’ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go
“I am sorry for her
alone
will be better indeed without you.”

“To be sure

“I? Why should I go?” Kitty said
round at her husband.

“Do you know Anna Arkadyevna
fascinating woman.”

“Yes
walked across to her husband.

“Are you going shooting

His jealousy had in these few moments
overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky
indeed. Now as he heard her words
fashion. Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it
him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting
all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to
Vassenka Veslovsky

“Yes
to himself.

“No
her husband

The motive of Kitty’s words was interpreted by Levin thus: “Don’t
separate me from _him_. I don’t care about _your_ going
enjoy the society of this delightful young man.”

“Oh
peculiar amiability.

Vassenka meanwhile
occasioned
smiling and admiring eyes

Levin saw that look. He turned white
breathe. “How dare he look at my wife like that!” was the feeling that
boiled within him.

“Tomorrow
a chair

Levin’s jealousy went further still. Already he saw himself a deceived
husband
provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life.... But in
spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about
his shooting
day.

Happily for Levin
herself and advising Kitty to go to bed. But even at this point Levin
could not escape another agony. As he said good-night to his hostess
Vassenka would again have kissed her hand
back her hand and said with a naïve bluntness
princess scolded her afterwards:

“We don’t like that fashion.”

In Levin’s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to
arise
not like them.

“Why
after drinking several glasses of wine at supper
charming and sentimental humor. “Look
moon
Veslovsky
voice; we practiced songs together along the road. He has brought some
lovely songs with him
some duets.”

When the party had broken up
about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing
one of the new songs.

Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife’s
bedroom
was wrong. But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the
question: “Was there perhaps something you disliked about
Veslovsky?”—it all burst out
himself at what he was saying

He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his
scowling brows
though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in. The expression
of his face would have been grim
same time had a look of suffering which touched her. His jaws were
twitching

“You must understand that I’m not jealous
be jealous
awful.... I’m not jealous
dare think

“Eyes like what?” said Kitty
recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied
in them.

At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something
precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other
end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself
have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him
increase his suffering.

“And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...”

“Ah!” he cried
you had been attractive then....”

“Oh
at him with an expression of pained commiseration. “Why
be thinking about! When for me there’s no one in the world
one!... Would you like me never to see anyone?”

For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was
angry that the slightest amusement
forbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed
such trifles
the agony he was suffering.

“You must understand the horror and comedy of my position
in a desperate whisper; “that he’s in my house
improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits
on his legs. He thinks it’s the best possible form
to be civil to him.”

“But
heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her
jealousy.

“The most awful part of it all is that you’re just as you always are
and especially now when to me you’re something sacred

with him. But why should my

beginning.

“Well

“I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.”

“Well

She told him what they had been talking about. And as she told him
was breathless with emotion. Levin was silent for a space
scanned her pale and distressed face
head.

“Katya

idiocy?”

“Oh

“For me? for me? How mad I am!... But why make you miserable? It’s
awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.”

“It’s humiliating too

“Oh

Next day

that they were going shooting
fro
disapproving of the delay
the sportsmen still did not come out. The first to come out was

observation and sank into repose again
ear pricked up to listen. At last the door opened with a creak
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out
and round and turning over in the air. Stepan Arkadyevitch himself
followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth.

“Good dog
his paws up on his chest
was dressed in rough leggings and spats
coat. On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form
his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem
cartridge belt

Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly _chic_
for a sportsman to be in tatters
the best quality. He saw it now as he looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch
radiant in his rags
nobleman. And he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he
would certainly adopt the same get-up.

“Well

“A young wife

“Yes

“He came down dressed. No doubt he’s run up to her again.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right. Levin had run up again to his wife
to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday
moreover
thing was for her to keep away from the children—they might any minute
push against her. Then he had once more to hear her declare that she
was not angry with him for going away for two days
be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback
write him
well with her.

Kitty was distressed
days from her husband
and strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse
sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her
her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure
cheerfully.

“Pardon
the lunch in? Why is the chestnut on the right? Well
matter. Laska

“Put it with the herd of oxen
waiting for him at the steps with some question. “Excuse me
another villain.”

Levin jumped out of the wagonette
seat
his hand.

“You didn’t come to the counting house yesterday
detaining me. Well

“Would your honor let me make another turning? It’s only three steps to
add. And we make it just fit at the same time. It will be much more
convenient.”

“You should have listened to me
said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps. Now there’s no setting
it right. Do as I told you

The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had
spoiled the staircase
space it was to fill
put in place. Now the carpenter wanted
add three steps.

“It will be much better.”

“But where’s your staircase coming out with its three steps?”

“Why
“It comes out right at the very spot. It starts
with a persuasive gesture; “it comes down
out.”

“But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come
out?”

“Why
come out so

“It’ll reach the ceiling and the wall.”

“Upon my word! Why

Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the
dust.

“There

“As your honor likes
eyes
best to make a new one.”

“Well
the wagonette. “Down! Hold the dogs

Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares
such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not
disposed to talk. Besides that
excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene
of action. If he had anything on his mind at that moment
the doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh
whether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak
whether he would shoot well that day himself. Not to disgrace himself
before a new spectator—not to be outdone by Oblonsky—that too was a
thought that crossed his brain.

Oblonsky was feeling the same
Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter. As he
listened to him now

elegance. It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in
himself that could not be disputed

forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding. Levin liked
him for his good education
an excellent accent

Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse
Don Steppes. He kept praising him enthusiastically. “How fine it must
be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse! Eh? isn’t it?” he
said. He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and
romantic
particularly in conjunction with his good looks
the grace of his movements

for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was
good in him

After they had driven over two miles from home

“Do you know what
That will be splendid. Eh?” he said

“No

The coachman rode back on the trace-horse
remaining pair.


Chapter 9

“Well
Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“Our plan is this. Now we’re driving to Gvozdyov. In Gvozdyov there’s a
grouse marsh on this side
snipe marshes where there are grouse too. It’s hot now
there—it’s fifteen miles or so—towards evening and have some evening
shooting; we’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger
moors.”

“And is there nothing on the way?”

“Yes; but we’ll reserve ourselves; besides it’s hot. There are two nice
little places

Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places
were near home; he could shoot them over any time
little places—there would hardly be room for three to shoot. And so
with some insincerity
shoot. When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by
Stepan Arkadyevitch
detected reeds visible from the road.

“Shan’t we try that?” he said

“Levin
and Levin could but consent.

Before they had time to stop
into the marsh.

“Krak! Laska!...”

The dogs came back.

“There won’t be room for three. I’ll stay here
they would find nothing but peewits
and turning over in their flight

“No! Come along

“Really

Levin remained with the wagonette
sportsmen. They walked right across the marsh. Except little birds and
peewits

“Come
Levin

“Oh
Veslovsky
peewit in his hands. “How splendidly I shot this bird! Didn’t I? Well
shall we soon be getting to the real place?”

The horses started off suddenly
stock of someone’s gun
actually go off first
that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger
other hammer still cocked. The charge flew into the ground without
doing harm to anyone. Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed
reprovingly at Veslovsky. But Levin had not the heart to reprove him.
In the first place
by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin’s
forehead. And besides
and then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general
dismay

When they reached the second marsh
inevitably take some time to shoot over
to pass it by. But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him. Again
marsh was narrow

Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge. Vassenka Veslovsky was the
first to run after the dog. Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come
up

again and pointed
“Now you go and I’ll stay with the horses

Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman’s envy. He handed the
reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.

Laska

Levin knew well

“Why don’t you stop her?” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“She won’t scare them
pleasure and hurrying after her.

As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was
more and more earnestness in Laska’s exploration. A little marsh bird
did not divert her attention for more than an instant. She made one
circuit round the clump of reeds
quivered with excitement and became motionless.

“Come
more violently; and all of a sudden
been drawn back from his straining ears
began to beat on his hearing
the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch

which he had trodden

Picking his steps

“Fetch it!”

Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog. Levin had lifted
his gun
splashing grew louder
Veslovsky’s voice
he had his gun pointed behind the snipe

When he had made sure he had missed
horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.

Veslovsky
got the horses stuck in the mud.

“Damn the fellow!” Levin said to himself
carriage that had sunk in the mire. “What did you drive in for?” he
said to him dryly
horses out.

Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses
getting stuck in the mud
Stepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to
unharness the horses and get them out
slightest notion of harnessing. Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply
to Vassenka’s protestations that it had been quite dry there
worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses. But
then
tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards
indeed
yesterday’s feelings been too cold to Veslovsky
particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness. When
everything had been put right
to the road

not letting go the rein

Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses
chestnut
fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he
sang all the way on the box
gave of driving in the English fashion
very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.


Chapter 10

Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too
early

As they drew near this more important marsh
expedition
Vassenka and be free in his movements. Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently
had the same desire
always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting
with a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.

“How shall we go? It’s a splendid marsh
said Stepan Arkadyevitch
reeds. “Where there are hawks

“Now
lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression
reeds?” He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown
wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river. “The marsh
begins here
From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding
places there
alder
pools are? That’s the best place. There I once shot seventeen snipe.
We’ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions
meet over there at the mill.”

“Well
Arkadyevitch. “It’s wider to the right; you two go that way and I’ll
take the left

“Capital! we’ll make the bigger bag! Yes
Vassenka exclaimed.

Levin could do nothing but agree

As soon as they entered the marsh
together and made towards the green

feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed
casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.

“Oh

But Levin could not help troubling
parting: “Mind you don’t shoot one another.” The dogs came nearer and
nearer
of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own
heel
snipe

“Bang! bang!” sounded almost in his ear. Vassenka had fired at a flock
of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment
towards the sportsmen
round
eight more rose one after another.

Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning
its zigzag movements
Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another
and together with the report of the shot
could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut
wing showing white beneath.

Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low
he aimed at it again
another snipe flew up at his very feet
missed again.

While they were loading their guns
who had had time to load again
water. Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe
looked at Levin.

“Well
his left foot
he walked off in one direction. Levin and Veslovsky walked in the
other.

It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure
he got hot and out of temper
that day. The snipe showed themselves in numbers. They kept flying up
from just under the dogs
might have retrieved his ill luck. But the more he shot
felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky
and indiscriminately
by his ill success. Levin
himself
without a hope of hitting. Laska
She began looking more languidly
it were
in rapid succession. The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen
while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three
light little snipe. And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky
alone
of the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s shots
frequent
they heard “Krak

This excited Levin still more. The snipe were floating continually in
the air over the reeds. Their whirring wings close to the earth
their harsh cries high in the air
snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air
before the sportsmen. Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of
them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.

After walking through the larger half of the marsh
reached the place where the peasants’ mowing-grass was divided into
long strips reaching to the reeds
trampled grass
strips had already been mown.

Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as
the cut part
so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.

“Hi
unharnessed cart; “come and have some lunch with us! Have a drop of
wine!”

Levin looked round.

“Come along

up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.

“_Qu’est-ce qu’ils disent_?” asked Veslovsky.

“They invite you to have some vodka. Most likely they’ve been dividing
the meadow into lots. I should have some
guile
away to them.

“Why do they offer it?”

“Oh
interested.”

“_Allons

“You go
looking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky
stumbling with weariness
making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants.

“You come too!” the peasants shouted to Levin. “Never fear! You taste
our cake!”

Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some
bread. He was exhausted
staggering legs out of the mire
Laska was setting. And immediately all his weariness vanished
walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog. A snipe flew up at
his feet; he fired and killed it. Laska still pointed.—“Fetch it!”
Another bird flew up close to the dog. Levin fired. But it was an
unlucky day for him; he missed it
he had shot
reeds
to find it
the absence of Vassenka
things went no better. There were plenty of snipe still
one miss after another.

The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes
through with perspiration
water weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat
ran in drops down his powder-grimed face
bitter taste
ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not
touch the stock of his gun
rapid throbs; his hands shook with excitement
stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp
walked on and still he shot. At last
flung his gun and his hat on the ground.

“No

dry ground he sat down
to the marsh
hot gun
to the spot where a snipe had settled

He tried to be calm
cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird. It got worse and
worse.

He had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh
towards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.

Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog. Krak
darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder
with the stinking mire of the marsh
sniffed at Laska. Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the
alder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch. He came to meet
him
same way.

“Well? You have been popping away!” he said

“How have you got on?” queried Levin. But there was no need to ask
he had already seen the full game bag.

“Oh

He had fourteen birds.

“A splendid marsh! I’ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way. It’s
awkward too

Chapter 11

When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant’s hut where
Levin always used to stay
in the middle of the hut
which he was being pulled by a soldier
wife
laughing his infectious

“I’ve only just come. _Ils ont été charmants_. Just fancy
drink
vodka
anything. And they kept saying: ‘Excuse our homely ways.’”

“What should they take anything for? They were entertaining you
sure. Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?” said the soldier
succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened
stocking.

In spite of the dirtiness of the hut
boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean
marsh mud and powder that filled the room
and forks
only known to sportsmen. Washed and clean

Though it was dusk

After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns

his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant
hay

Malthus was a well-known capitalist
speculation in railway shares. Stepan Arkadyevitch described what
grouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province
were preserved
party had been driven
up at the marsh.

“I don’t understand you
such people don’t disgust you? I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is
all very pleasant
All these people
their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone. They
don’t care for their contempt
to buy off the contempt they have deserved.”

“Perfectly true!” chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky. “Perfectly! Oblonsky
of course
Oblonsky stays with them.’...”

“Not a bit of it.” Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he
spoke. “I simply don’t consider him more dishonest than any other
wealthy merchant or nobleman. They’ve all made their money alike—by
their work and their intelligence.”

“Oh
speculate with them?”

“Of course it’s work. Work in this sense
and others like him

“But that’s not work
profession.”

“Granted
result—the railways. But of course you think the railways useless.”

“No
useful. But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended
is dishonest.”

“But who is to define what is proportionate?”

“Making profit by dishonest means
that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.
“Such as banking

railways came up

“Yes
Arkadyevitch called to his dog
the hay. He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position
and so talked serenely and without haste. “But you have not drawn the
line between honest and dishonest work. That I receive a bigger salary
than my chief clerk
do—that’s dishonest

“I can’t say.”

“Well

“Well

“No

came into the barn

“No

he added

“And where are you going to sleep?”

“We are going out for the night with the beasts.”

“Ah

the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors. “But listen

“What do you say

Levin did not answer. What they had said in the conversation
acted justly only in a negative sense
be that it’s only possible to be just negatively?” he was asking
himself.

“How strong the smell of the fresh hay is
Arkadyevitch

voice? Hadn’t we better go? Come along!”

“No

“Surely that’s not a matter of principle too

“It’s not a matter of principle

Arkadyevitch

“How so?”

“Do you suppose I don’t see the line you’ve taken up with your wife? I
heard how it’s a question of the greatest consequence
you’re to be away for a couple of days’ shooting. That’s all very well

“In what way? To go running after servant girls?” said Levin.

Levin pretended to be asleep
and lighting a cigar
were lost.

For a long while Levin could not get to sleep. He heard the horses
munching hay

boy’s questions
catch it
still. He could only hear the snort of the horses

“Is it really only negative?” he repeated to himself. “Well
it? It’s not my fault.” And he began thinking about the next day.

“Tomorrow I’ll go out early
There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. When I come back
there’ll be the note from Kitty. Yes
with her
Negative again....”

Half asleep
Stepan Arkadyevitch. For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was
up
were standing talking. Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the
freshness of one girl
Veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words
said to him by a peasant: “Ah

“Gentlemen


Chapter 12

Waking up at earliest dawn
Vassenka
was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response. Oblonsky

sunburnt
fence for him by the threshing floor.

“Straight on and you’ll come to the marsh. Our lads drove the cattle
there yesterday evening.”

Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path. Levin followed her
with a light
sun would not be up before he reached the marsh. But the sun did not
delay. The moon
only like a crescent of quicksilver. The pink flush of dawn
could not help seeing before
all. What were before undefined
could now be distinctly seen. They were sheaves of rye. The dew
visible till the sun was up
his belt in the high growing
pollen had already fallen out. In the transparent stillness of morning
the smallest sounds were audible. A bee flew by Levin’s ear with the
whizzing sound of a bullet. He looked carefully
third. They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge
they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh. The
path led straight to the marsh. The marsh could be recognized by the
mist which rose from it
so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist.
At the edge of the marsh and the road
been herding for the night
under their coats. Not far from them were three hobbled horses. One of
them clanked a chain. Laska walked beside her master
forward and looking round. Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching
the first reeds
the horses
away
frightened
and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound
they bounded out of the marsh. Laska stopped
horses and inquiringly at Levin. Levin patted Laska
sign that she might begin.

Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under
her.

Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots
plants
detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh

Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very

and more and more defined

Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and
the peculiar round sound of its wings. And immediately after the shot
it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire. Another bird
did not linger

When Levin

luster

stagnant pools were all like amber. The blue of the grass had changed
to yellow-green. The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook
and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows. A
hawk woke up and settled on a haycock
side and looking discontentedly at the marsh. Crows were flying about
the field
who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair. The
smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.

One of the boys ran up to Levin.

These two pleasures
were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly
over Levin. One was that the chestnut trace horse
unmistakably overworked on the previous day
of sorts. The coachman said he was “Overdriven yesterday

But when he had drunk some milk

“What will you take

“Neither. I’ll wait till lunch. I’m really ashamed. I suppose the
ladies are down? A walk now would be capital. You show me your horses.”

After walking about the garden

“We had splendid shooting

He went downstairs

The German would have left the room

“Don’t disturb yourself.”

“The train is at three?” queried the German. “I mustn’t be late.”

Levin did not answer him

“Well

He did not look her in the face
her condition was trembling all over

“I ... I want to say that we can’t go on like this; that this is

“The servants are here at the sideboard

In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path. And no longer

Dolly. “What’s going on there?”

And in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy for
him to say what he had meant to say.

“I’ve not been in there
We’ve had a quarrel for the second time since ... Stiva came.”

Dolly looked at him with her shrewd

“Yes

“Not only I

“Well

“What do you mean! Are you crazy?” Dolly cried in horror; “nonsense

The mother glanced at her. The child broke into sobs

“And what is there in common between us and him?” thought Levin
went off to look for Veslovsky.

As he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be
got ready to drive to the station.

“The spring was broken yesterday

“Well

“The gentleman’s gone to his room.”

Levin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter
unpacked his things from his trunk

“Please don’t go into it! I can’t help it. I feel ashamed of how I’m

Chapter 16

Darya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna. She
was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked. She
quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have
anything to do with Vronsky. But she felt she must go and see Anna
show her that her feelings could not be changed
in her position. That she might be independent of the Levins in this
expedition
the drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.

“What makes you suppose that I dislike your going? But
dislike it
said. “You never told me that you were going for certain. Hiring horses
in the village is disagreeable to me
they’ll undertake the job and never get you there. I have horses. And
if you don’t want to wound me

Darya Alexandrovna had to consent
for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays
together from the farm and saddle-horses—not at all a smart-looking
set

who was going
to make up the number

pecuniary affairs
taken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.

Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where
the horses were to be changed.

stayed on the way to Sviazhsky’s

So now
suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain
all her life as she never had before
points of view. Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself. At first
she thought about the children
princess and Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look
after them. “If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks
isn’t kicked by a horse
thought. But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions
of the immediate future. She began thinking how she had to get a new
flat in Moscow for the coming winter
furniture
more remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children
in the world. “The girls are all right

“It’s very well that I’m teaching Grisha
because I am free myself now
there’s no counting on. And with the help of good-natured friends I can
bring them up; but if there’s another baby coming?...” And the thought
struck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was
that in sorrow she should bring forth children.

“The birth itself

the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn. On
being asked whether she had any children
answered cheerfully:

“I had a girl baby

“Well

“Why grieve? The old man has grandchildren enough as it is. It was only
a trouble. No working

This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the
good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could
not help recalling these words. In those cynical words there was indeed
a grain of truth.

“Yes

and most of all—hideousness. Kitty
Kitty has lost her looks; and I when I’m with child become hideous
know it. The birth

Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from
sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child. “Then the
children’s illnesses

raspberries)

“And all this

the thought; but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of
brutal truth in the words.

“Is it far now

“From this village
along the village street and onto a bridge. On the bridge was a crowd
of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders

“And they attack Anna. What for? am I any better? I have

while Anna never loved hers. How is she to blame? She wants to live.
God has put that in our hearts. Very likely I should have done the
same. Even to this day I don’t feel sure I did right in listening to
her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow. I ought then
to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh. I might have
loved and have been loved in reality. And is it any better as it is? I
don’t respect him. He’s necessary to me

Alexandrovna pursued her thoughts
herself in the looking-glass. She had a traveling looking-glass in her
handbag

be ashamed if either of them were to look round
out the glass.

But without looking in the glass
too late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch

more beautiful than either of her sisters. And the most passionate and
impossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna’s imagination. “Anna

Alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love
affair for herself
who was in love with her. She
her husband. And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at
this avowal made her smile.

In such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to
Vozdvizhenskoe.


Chapter 17

The coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right
to a field of rye
counting-house clerk was just going to jump down
thoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead
to them to come up. The wind
dropped when the carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming
horses that angrily shook them off. The metallic clank of a whetstone
against a scythe
peasants got up and came towards the carriage.

“Well

rough dry road. “Come along

something to him from the cart. “Oh! They all rode by here not long
since

“We’ve come a long way

“I tell you

The coachman started the horses
when the peasant shouted: “Stop! Hi
voices. The coachman stopped.

“They’re coming! They’re yonder!” shouted the peasant. “See what a
turn-out!” he said
_char-à-banc_

They were Vronsky with a jockey
Princess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the _char-à-banc_. They had gone out
to look at the working of a new reaping machine.

When the carriage stopped

her horse
beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat
her full shoulders
all the ease and grace of her deportment

For the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for Anna to be on
horseback. The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was
Darya Alexandrovna’s mind
and frivolity

at once reconciled to her riding. In spite of her elegance
was so simple

Beside Anna
Veslovsky in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons
stretched out in front
Darya Alexandrovna could not suppress a good-humored smile as she
recognized him. Behind rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare
heated from galloping. He was holding her in

After him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey. Sviazhsky and
Princess Varvara in a new _char-à-banc_ with a big
trotting horse

Anna’s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when
the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage
recognized Dolly. She uttered a cry
horse into a gallop. On reaching the carriage she jumped off without
assistance

“I thought it was you and dared not think it. How delightful! You can’t
fancy how glad I am!” she said
Dolly and kissing her
her with a smile.

“Here’s a delightful surprise

in a smile.

Vassenka Veslovsky
greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.

“That’s Princess Varvara
from Dolly as the _char-à-banc_ drove up.

“Ah!” said Darya Alexandrovna
dissatisfaction.

Princess Varvara was her husband’s aunt
and did not respect her. She knew that Princess Varvara had passed her
whole life toadying on her rich relations
sponging on Vronsky
account of her kinship with her husband. Anna noticed Dolly’s
expression
habit

Darya Alexandrovna went up to the _char-à-banc_ and coldly greeted
Princess Varvara. Sviazhsky too she knew. He inquired how his queer
friend with the young wife was
ill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards
proposed to the ladies that they should get into the _char-à-banc_.

“And I’ll get into this vehicle

“No

Darya Alexandrovna’s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage
of a pattern she had never seen before
elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her. But what struck her most
of all was the change that had taken place in Anna
well and loved. Any other woman

with the right leg foremost—it was all peculiarly fascinating

When both the women were seated in the carriage
came over both of them. Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of
inquiry Dolly fixed upon her. Dolly was embarrassed because after
Sviazhsky’s phrase about “this vehicle
ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting with her.
The coachman Philip and the counting-house clerk were experiencing the
same sensation. The counting-house clerk
busied himself settling the ladies
sullen
external superiority. He smiled ironically
and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the
_char-à-banc_ was only good for _promenage_
miles straight off in the heat.

The peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and
mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends
on it.

“They’re pleased

“How glad I am!” said Dolly smiling

me?”

“Why?... Because I hadn’t the courage.... You forget my position....”

“To me? Hadn’t the courage? If you knew how I ... I look at....”

Darya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning
for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.

“But of that we’ll talk later. What’s this
buildings?” she asked
to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges
of acacia and lilac. “Quite a little town.”

But Anna did not answer.

“No

“I consider....” Darya Alexandrovna was beginning

Anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya

carriage

“I don’t think anything

Anna
(this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before)
trying to penetrate the full significance of the words. And obviously
interpreting them as she would have wished

“If you had any sins

And Dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes. She pressed Anna’s hand in
silence.

it
and sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she had
only read in English novels

to the carpet which covered the whole floor. The bed had a spring
mattress
little pillows. The marble washstand

curtains

The smart maid
up high
expensive as the whole room. Darya Alexandrovna liked her neatness
deferential and obliging manners
She felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had
unluckily been packed by mistake for her. She was ashamed of the very
patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home. At
home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be
needed twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard
was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making
and these thirty shillings had been saved. But before the maid she
felt

Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka
had known for years
her mistress

Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady’s arrival
to chatter away without a pause. Dolly observed that she was longing to
express her opinion in regard to her mistress’s position
to the love and devotion of the count to Anna Arkadyevna
carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this.

“I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady’s dearer to me than anything.
Well
love....”

“Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now
Alexandrovna cut her short.

“Certainly. We’ve two women kept specially for washing small things
but most of the linen’s done by machinery. The count goes into
everything himself. Ah

Dolly was glad when Anna came in
Annushka’s gossip.

Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown. Dolly scrutinized that
simple gown attentively. She knew what it meant
such simplicity was obtained.

“An old friend

Anna was not embarrassed now. She was perfectly composed and at ease.
Dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her
arrival had made on her
tone which
her deeper feelings and ideas were kept.

“Well

“Annie?” (This was what she called her little daughter Anna.) “Very
well. She has got on wonderfully. Would you like to see her? Come
show her to you. We had a terrible bother
“over nurses. We had an Italian wet-nurse. A good creature
stupid! We wanted to get rid of her
that we’ve gone on keeping her still.”

“But how have you managed?...” Dolly was beginning a question as to
what name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on
Anna’s face

“How did you manage? have you weaned her yet?”

But Anna had understood.

“You didn’t mean to ask that? You meant to ask about her surname. Yes?
That worries Alexey. She has no name—that is
Anna

brightening. “Come

In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house
struck her still more. There were little go-carts ordered from England
and appliances for learning to walk

I am so grateful to her. In Petersburg there was a moment when a

Chapter 20

“Here’s Dolly for you
Anna
Princess Varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame
working at a cover for Count Alexey Kirillovitch’s easy chair. “She
says she doesn’t want anything before dinner
lunch for her

Princess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception
and began at once explaining to her that she was living with Anna
because she had always cared more for her than her sister Katerina
Pavlovna
everyone had abandoned Anna
this most difficult period of transition.

“Her husband will give her a divorce
solitude; but now I can be of use
difficult it may be for me—not like some other people. And how sweet it
is of you
married couples; it’s for God to judge them
Biryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov
and Madame Mamonova
about them? And it has ended by their being received by everyone. And
then

Everyone does as he pleases till dinner time. Dinner at seven o’clock.
Stiva did very rightly to send you. He needs their support. You know
that through his mother and brother he can do anything. And then they
do so much good. He didn’t tell you about his hospital? _Ce sera
admirable_—everything from Paris.”

Their conversation was interrupted by Anna
the party in the billiard room
There was still a long time before the dinner-hour
weather
hours were proposed. There were very many methods of passing the time
at Vozdvizhenskoe
Pokrovskoe.

“No
boat

“I agree to anything

“I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll—wouldn’t
you? And then the boat

So it was decided. Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing
place

They walked along the path in two couples
Dolly with Vronsky. Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the
new surroundings in which she found herself. Abstractly
she did not merely justify
As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue
of the monotony of respectable existence
excused illicit love
with all her heart. But seeing Anna in actual life among these
strangers
Alexandrovna
seeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of
the comforts she enjoyed.

As a general principle
but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was
disagreeable to her. Moreover
him very proud
except his wealth. But against her own will
overawed her more than ever
felt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her
dressing jacket. Just as with the maid she had felt not exactly
ashamed
ashamed

Dolly was ill at ease
Even though she supposed that
and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him
same tell him how much she liked his house.

“Yes
he said.

“I like so much the court in front of the steps. Was that always so?”

“Oh
only have seen that court last spring!”

And he began
away by the subject as he went on
details of the decoration of his house and garden. It was evident that
having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his
home
and was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna’s praise.

“If you would care to look at the hospital
it’s not far. Shall we go?” he said
himself that she was not bored. “Are you coming
her.

“We will come

“Yes
Dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had
previously talked about the hospital.

“Oh

some slightly critical remarks.

“I wonder

“_C’est devenu tellement commun les écoles
understand it’s not on that account
interest has been diverted elsewhere. This way then to the hospital
he said to Darya Alexandrovna

The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path. After
going down several turnings
Alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large
pretentious-looking red building
was not yet painted
Beside the finished building another had been begun
scaffolding. Workmen in aprons
bricks

“How quickly work gets done with you!” said Sviazhsky. “When I was here
last time the roof was not on.”

“By the autumn it will all be ready. Inside almost everything is done
said Anna.

“And what’s this new building?”

“That’s the house for the doctor and the dispensary
seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him; and excusing
himself to the ladies

Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime
with the architect and began talking rather warmly.

“The front is still too low
the matter.

“I said the foundation ought to be raised

“Yes

“Yes
expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture. “This new
building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital. It was an
afterthought

Vronsky

Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were

“This way; let us go in here. Don’t go near the window

From the reception room they went into the corridor. Here Vronsky
showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system. Then he
showed them marble baths
showed them the wards one after another
then the heating stove of a new pattern
make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors
and many other things. Sviazhsky
mechanical improvements
wondered at all she had not seen before
all
satisfaction.

“Yes

“And won’t you have a lying-in ward?” asked Dolly. “That’s so much
needed in the country. I have often....”

In spite of his usual courtesy

“This is not a lying-in home
intended for all diseases
look at this
that had just been ordered for the convalescents. “Look.” He sat down
in the chair and began moving it. “The patient can’t walk—still too
weak
and he moves

Darya Alexandrovna was interested by everything. She liked everything
very much
simple-hearted eagerness. “Yes
thought several times
penetrating into his expression
Anna’s place. She liked him so much just now with his eager interest
that she saw how Anna could be in love with him.


Chapter 21

“No
Vronsky said to Anna
Sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion. “You go on
the princess home
would like that?” he added

“I know nothing about horses
Alexandrovna

She saw by Vronsky’s face that he wanted something from her. She was
not mistaken. As soon as they had passed through the little gate back
into the garden
made sure that she could neither hear nor see them

“You guess that I have something I want to say to you
looking at her with laughing eyes. “I am not wrong in believing you to
be a friend of Anna’s.” He took off his hat
handkerchief

Darya Alexandrovna made no answer
dismay. When she was left alone with him
laughing eyes and stern expression scared her.

The most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to
her flashed into her brain. “He is going to beg me to come to stay with
them with the children
that will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn’t it Vassenka Veslovsky and
his relations with Anna? Or perhaps about Kitty
to blame?” All her conjectures were unpleasant
what he really wanted to talk about to her.

“You have so much influence with Anna
“do help me.”

Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face
which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches
by the sunshine
waited for him to say more
scratching with his cane in the gravel.

“You have come to see us
friends—I don’t count Princess Varvara—but I know that you have done
this not because you regard our position as normal
understanding all the difficulty of the position
and want to be a help to her. Have I understood you rightly?” he asked
looking round at her.

“Oh
“but....”

“No
into which he was putting his companion
she had to stop short too. “No one feels more deeply and intensely than
I do all the difficulty of Anna’s position; and that you may well
understand
to blame for that position

“I understand
sincerity and firmness with which he said this. “But just because you
feel yourself responsible
“Her position in the world is difficult

“In the world it is hell!” he brought out quickly
“You can’t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through
in Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you to believe it.”

“Yes

“Society!” he said contemptuously

“So far—and it may be so always—you are happy and at peace. I see in
Anna that she is happy
much already
she said this
really were happy.

But Vronsky

“Yes
sufferings; she is happy. She is happy in the present. But I?... I am
afraid of what is before us ... I beg your pardon
walk on?”

“No

“Well

Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.
He stood up facing her.

“I see that she is happy
happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna’s mind. “But can it
last? Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question
the die is cast
bound together for life. We are united by all the ties of love that we
hold most sacred. We have a child
law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of
complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see.
And that one can well understand. But I can’t help seeing them. My
daughter is by law not my daughter
falsity!” he said
with gloomy inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.

She made no answer

“One day a son may be born
he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property
happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have
there will be no real tie between us. They will be Karenins. You can
understand the bitterness and horror of this position! I have tried to
speak of this to Anna. It irritates her. She does not understand
to her I cannot speak plainly of all this. Now look at another side. I
am happy

the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army. And most
certainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs. I am
working here
and we need nothing more to make us happy. I love my work here. _Ce
n’est pas un pis-aller

Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he
grew confused
she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart
which he could not speak to Anna
everything
into the same category of matters near his heart
his relations with Anna.

“Well
that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will
not die with me
have not. Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children
the children of the woman he loves
someone who hates them and cares nothing about them! It is awful!”

He paused

“Yes
Alexandrovna.

“Yes

that depends on Anna. Her husband agreed to a divorce—at that time your
husband had arranged it completely. And now

that time that if she expressed the desire

matter is of such importance

someone for its being hard for him. “And so it is
shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation. Help me to
persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.”

“Yes
recalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch. “Yes
course

“Use your influence with her
unable to speak about this to her.”

“Very well
herself?” said Darya Alexandrovna
that point recalled Anna’s strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.
And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper
questions of life were touched upon. “Just as though she half-shut her
eyes to her own life
“Yes
said in reply to his look of gratitude.

They got up and walked to the house.


Chapter 22

When Anna found Dolly at home before her
eyes
Vronsky

“I believe it’s dinner time
all yet. I am reckoning on the evening. Now I want to go and dress. I
expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.”

Dolly went to her room and she felt amused. To change her dress was
impossible

“This is all I can do
her in a third dress

“Yes
magnificence. “Alexey is delighted at your visit
anything. He has completely lost his heart to you
not tired?”

There was no time for talking about anything before dinner. Going into
the drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there
gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats. The architect wore a
swallow-tail coat. Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his
guest. The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.

A stout butler
starched white cravat
got up. Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna
offered his arm to Dolly. Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering
his arm to Princess Varvara
the doctor walked in alone.

The dinner

and modern. Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to
her
she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household
it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living—she
could not help scrutinizing every detail
it was all done. Vassenka Veslovsky

in his house has cost him
itself. Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the
children’s breakfast does not come of itself
so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained
someone must give earnest attention to its organization. And from the
glance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table
he nodded to the butler
between cold soup and hot soup
maintained by the care of the master of the house himself. It was
evident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky. She

hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.

Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation. The
conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small
table with persons present
belonging to a completely different world
overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed
sustain a large share in the general conversation. But this difficult
conversation Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness
indeed she did so with actual enjoyment
observed. The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and
Veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat
describing the last boat races in Petersburg at the Yacht Club. But
Anna
him out of his silence.

“Nikolay Ivanitch was struck
progress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am
there every day

“It’s first-rate working with his excellency
a smile (he was respectful and composed
dignity). “It’s a very different matter to have to do with the district
authorities. Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers
I call upon the count

“The American way of doing business

“Yes

The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United
States
draw the steward into talk.

“Have you ever seen a reaping machine?” she said
Alexandrovna. “We had just ridden over to look at one when we met. It’s
the first time I ever saw one.”

“How do they work?” asked Dolly.

“Exactly like little scissors. A plank and a lot of little scissors.
Like this.”

Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with
rings
saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that
her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.

“More like little penknives

Anna gave a just perceptible smile
Karl Fedoritch
steward.

“_Oh
and he began to explain the construction of the machine.

“It’s a pity it doesn’t bind too. I saw one at the Vienna exhibition
which binds with a wire

_“Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.”_
And the German

he concluded.

_“Wünscht man Dochots

Anna again with the same smile.

_“Cessez

“We expected to find you in the fields

“I went there
jocoseness.

“Then you’ve taken a good constitutional?”

“Splendid!”

“Well

“Typhus it is not

“What a pity!” said Anna
her domestic circle

“It would be a hard task
description

“Oh
there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that
had been noticed by Sviazhsky. This new trait of girlish coquettishness
made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.

“But Anna Arkadyevna’s knowledge of architecture is marvelous
Tushkevitch.

“To be sure
and damp-courses

“There’s nothing marvelous about it
it
made of?”

Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that
existed between her and Veslovsky
will.

Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin. He obviously
attached no significance to Veslovsky’s chattering; on the contrary
encouraged his jests.

“Come now

“By cement

“Bravo! And what is cement?”

“Oh
general laugh.

The company at dinner
and the steward
conversation that never paused
another
Darya Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick
positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said
anything extreme or unpleasant. Sviazhsky began talking of Levin
describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its
effects on Russian agriculture.

“I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin
smiling
or if he has seen and tried any
fashion
of views can anyone have on such a subject?”

“Turkish views
smile.

“I can’t defend his opinions
I can say that he’s a highly cultivated man
would know very well how to answer you
doing so.”

“I like him extremely
smiling good-naturedly. “_Mais pardon

are all of no use

“It’s our Russian apathy
decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; “we’ve no sense of the
duties our privileges impose upon us
these duties.”

“I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties
Darya Alexandrovna

“For my part
other keenly affected by this conversation
contrary
Nikolay Ivanitch” (he indicated Sviazhsky)
of the peace. I consider that for me the duty of being present at the
session
important as anything I can do. And I shall regard it as an honor if
they elect me for the district council. It’s only in that way I can pay
for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner. Unluckily they don’t
understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the
state.”

It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he
was of being right at his own table. She thought how Levin
believed the opposite
table. But she loved Levin

“So we can reckon upon you
Sviazhsky. “But you must come a little beforehand
spot by the eighth. If you would do me the honor to stop with me.”

“I rather agree with your _beau-frère_
on the same ground as he
have too many of these public duties in these latter days. Just as in
old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to
call in a functionary for every single thing
some sort of public duty. Alexey has been here now six months

that with such a multiplicity of these bodies

to Sviazhsky—“over twenty

Anna spoke lightly
Darya Alexandrovna
instantly. She noticed
immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression. Noticing this
and that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation
by talking of Petersburg acquaintances
had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the
country
connected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.

The dinner
but it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners
and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it
all had the same impersonal and constrained character
ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable
impression on her.

After dinner they sat on the terrace
tennis. The players
of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and
rolled croquet-ground. Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play
it was a long time before she could understand the game

They kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them

he kept the players lively with his high spirits. His laughter and
outcries never paused. Like the other men of the party

When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night

During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself. She did
not like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time
between Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna
of grown-up people
game. But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time
somehow
enjoying it. All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in
a theater with actors cleverer than she
spoiling the whole performance. She had come with the intention of
staying two days
game
maternal cares and worries
after a day spent without them
tempted her back to them.

When
Alexandrovna went alone to her room
arranging her thin hair for the night

It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna was coming to
see her immediately. She longed to be alone with her own thoughts.


Chapter 23

Dolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her
for the night. In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to
speak of matters near her heart
had stopped: “Afterwards
I’ve got so much I want to tell you

Now they were by themselves
She sat in the window looking at Dolly
all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible
beforehand
everything had been said already.

“Well
at Dolly. “Tell me the truth

“Angry? Oh

“But she hates me

“Oh

“Yes
“But I was not to blame. And who is to blame? What’s the meaning of
being to blame? Could it have been otherwise? What do you think? Could
it possibly have happened that you didn’t become the wife of Stiva?”

“Really

“Yes
very nice man

“He’s much more than very nice. I don’t know a better man.”

“Ah
repeated.

Dolly smiled.

“But tell me about yourself. We’ve a great deal to talk about. And I’ve
had a talk with....” Dolly did not know what to call him. She felt it
awkward to call him either the count or Alexey Kirillovitch.

“With Alexey
to ask you directly what you think of me

“How am I to say like that straight off? I really don’t know.”

“No

“Of course
I won’t try to keep him by force. I don’t keep him indeed. The races
are just coming

“He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself

you could not....” (Darya Alexandrovna hesitated) “correct

“What wife

“That’s impossible. Well?”

“Well

deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the
first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in
will have to reflect a great

This discovery

at Anna. This was the very thing she had been dreaming of
learning that it was possible
too simple a solution of too complicated a problem.

_“N’est-ce pas immoral?”_ was all she said

“Why so? Think
with child
husband—practically my husband
superficial and frivolous.

“Yes
used to herself

“For you
thoughts
consider
how am I to keep his love? Not like this!”

She moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with
extraordinary rapidity
and memories rushed into Darya Alexandrovna’s head. “I
“did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for others
first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always
pretty and lively. He deserted her and took another. And can Anna
attract and keep Count Vronsky in that way? If that is what he looks
for
charming. And however white and beautiful her bare arms are
beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls
will find something better still
charming husband does.”

Dolly made no answer
indicating dissent
arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.

“Do you say that it’s not right? But you must consider
“you forget my position. How can I desire children? I’m not speaking of
the suffering
to be? Ill-fated children
the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their
mother

“But that is just why a divorce is necessary.” But Anna did not hear
her. She longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she
had so many times convinced herself.

“What is reason given me for
unhappy beings into the world!” She looked at Dolly
waiting for a reply she went on:

“I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children
“If they are not
unhappy

These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own
reflections; but she heard them without understanding them. “How can
one wrong creatures that don’t exist?” she thought. And all at once the
idea struck her: could it possibly
better for her favorite Grisha if he had never existed? And this seemed
to her so wild
tangle of whirling

“No
expression of disgust on her face.

“Yes
added Anna
Dolly’s objections
“don’t forget the chief point
as you. For you the question is: do you desire not to have any more
children; while for me it is: do I desire to have them? And that’s a
great difference. You must see that I can’t desire it in my position.”

Darya Alexandrovna made no reply. She suddenly felt that she had got
far away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions
on which they could never agree
speak.

“Yes

“Oh
and quite under my control. You know
as it might be with your Grisha.... Dolly!”—she suddenly changed the
subject—“you say I take too gloomy a view of things. You can’t
understand. It’s too awful! I try not to take any view of it at all.”

“But I think you ought to. You ought to do all you can.”

“But what can I do? Nothing. You tell me to marry Alexey
don’t think about it. I don’t think about it!” she repeated
flush rose into her face. She got up
sighed heavily. With her light step she began pacing up and down the
room

“You ought to make the attempt

“Suppose I make the attempt. What does it mean?” she said
giving utterance to a thought
learned by heart. “It means that I

She came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly
her arms pressed tightly across her chest. In her white dressing gown
her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad. She bent her head
and with shining
little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap
shaking all over with emotion.

“It is only those two creatures that I love
other. I can’t have them together
And since I can’t have that
about anything

“What are you thinking? What are you thinking about me? Don’t despise
me. I don’t deserve contempt. I’m simply unhappy. If anyone is unhappy
I am

Left alone
had felt for Anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her
now she could not force herself to think of her. The memories of home
and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm
quite new to her
seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any
account spend an extra day outside it
she would certainly go back next day.

Anna meantime went back to her boudoir
into it several drops of a medicine
was morphine. After drinking it off and sitting still a little while
she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.

When she went into the bedroom
looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that
long in Dolly’s room
of restrained excitement
nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was
used to it

but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord. But
she only said:

“I am so glad you like Dolly. You do

“Oh
suppose
see her.”

He took Anna’s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes.

Misinterpreting the look
the protests of her hosts
journey. Levin’s coachman
with his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched mud-guards
drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.

Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the
gentlemen of the party. After a day spent together
hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together
it was better for them not to meet. Only Anna was sad. She knew that
now
the feelings that had been roused by their conversation. It hurt her to
stir up these feelings
her soul
the life she was leading.

As she drove out into the open country
delightful sense of relief
they had liked being at Vronsky’s
expressed himself unasked:

“Rolling in wealth they may be
gave us. Everything cleared up till there wasn’t a grain left by
cockcrow. What are three pots? A mere mouthful! And oats now down to
forty-five kopecks. At our place
as they can eat.”

“The master’s a screw

“Well

“The horses!—there’s no two opinions about them. And the food was good.
But it seemed to me sort of dreary there

Chapter 25

Vronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the
country
to obtain a divorce. It was an understood thing between them that they
should not go away anywhere; but both felt
alone

Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.
They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child
both had occupation. Anna devoted just as much care to her appearance

the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she
received

And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid

one point of view this troubled him
it was better so. “At first there will be

In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty’s confinement. He had
spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do
Ivanovitch
interest in the question of the approaching elections
set off to the elections. He invited his brother
Seleznevsky district
transact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the
wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for
his sister

Levin still hesitated
and urged him to go
nobleman’s uniform
for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.
He went to Kashin....

Levin had been six days in Kashin
busily engaged about his sister’s business
district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections
it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the
court of wardship. The other matter
met too by difficulties. After long negotiations over the legal
details

given over his duties to a deputy
worrying negotiations
talking with pleasant and excellent people
unpleasantness of the petitioner’s position
assist him—all these efforts that yielded no result
of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences
in dreams when one tries to use physical force. He felt this frequently
as he talked to his most good-natured solicitor. This solicitor did
seemed
his difficulties. “I tell you what you might try
once; “go to so-and-so and so-and-so

everything. But he would add immediately

Levin could not make out with whom he was struggling
it was that his business should not be done. That no one seemed to
know; the solicitor certainly did not know. If Levin could have
understood why

vexatious and tiresome to him. But with the hindrances that confronted
him in his business

But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient
and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this
himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it
most likely it must be so

In attending the elections
not to judge
he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing
honest and excellent men whom he respected. Since his marriage there
had been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that
had previously
importance
tried to find some serious significance.

Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the
proposed revolution at the elections. The marshal of the province in
whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public
functions—the guardianship of wards (the very department which was
giving Levin so much trouble just now)

question
the spread of popular education
party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of
such an immense importance. What was needed was to put in his place a
fresh
frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles
as the nobility
all the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from
them. In the wealthy Kashinsky province
other provinces in everything
forces that this policy
serve as a model for other provinces for all Russia. And hence the
whole question was of the greatest importance. It was proposed to elect
as marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky
Nevyedovsky
intelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.

The meeting was opened by the governor

for persons
hoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would

When he had finished with his speech

his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.

thereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and
all drove off to the cathedral.

In the cathedral Levin

the governor had hoped they would do. Church services always affected

round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same

On the second and third days there was business relating to the
finances of the nobility and the female high school
whatever
his own affairs
auditing of the marshal’s accounts took place at the high table of the
marshal of the province. And then there occurred the first skirmish
between the new party and the old. The committee who had been deputed
to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.
The marshal of the province got up
confidence
shook hands with him. But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey
Ivanovitch’s party said that he had heard that the committee had not
verified the accounts
marshal of the province. One of the members of the committee
incautiously admitted this. Then a small gentleman
but very malignant
the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of
the public moneys
the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction. Then the
members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission
Ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that
they had verified the accounts or that they had not
this dilemma in detail. Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman
of the opposite party. Then Sviazhsky spoke
gentleman again. The discussion lasted a long time and ended in
nothing. Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject
so long
supposed that money had been misappropriated
answered:

“Oh
paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs
must be broken down.”

On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals. It was
rather a stormy day in several districts. In the Seleznevsky district
Sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot

The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the

The nobles
themselves in camps

classes: the old and the new. The old were for the most part either in
old uniforms of the nobility
or in their own special naval

the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there
brightened up the crowd.

But the division into young and old did not correspond with the
division of parties. Some of the young men
to the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen

trying to understand what was said. Sergey Ivanovitch was the center
round which the others grouped themselves. He was listening at that
moment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov

district to ask Snetkov to stand

wanted to supersede.

Stepan Arkadyevitch

“We are placing our forces

And listening to the conversation

glad indeed to be converted
and retreating a few steps from the speakers
Arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the
province should be asked to stand.

_“O sancta simplicitas!”_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch
clearly he explained it to Levin. If
districts asked the marshal of the province to stand
elected without a ballot. That must not be. Now eight districts had
agreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so
to stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their
party
only one district
would let himself be balloted for. They were even
to vote for him

“What is it? eh? whom?” “No guarantee? whose? what?” “They won’t pass

a swindle!” “The law!” Levin heard exclamations on all sides

Levin was standing rather far off. A nobleman breathing heavily and
hoarsely at his side
prevented him from hearing distinctly. He could only hear the soft
voice of the marshal faintly

the exact meaning of the words: “liable to be called up for trial.”

He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but
it was evident that he hated him and all his party

words. They expressed the most implacable hatred. Levin did not in the
least understand what was the matter
with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov
should be put to the vote. He forgot
him afterwards
good to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the
marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a
majority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov’s right to vote;
that to secure the recognition of Flerov’s right to vote they must
decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.

“And one vote may decide the whole question

Sergey Ivanovitch. But Levin forgot all that
to see all these excellent persons
an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement. To escape from this
painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody
except the waiters at the refreshment bar. Seeing the waiters busy over
washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and
wine-glasses
unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room
into the fresh air. He began walking up and down
at the waiters. He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered
waiter
at by them
was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter

was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic

“Please come
looking for you. They are voting on the legal point.”

Levin walked into the room

out the voice of the secretary
Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.

But the old party did not consider themselves conquered. Levin heard

of the room. Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice
being done him

In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.

And the marshal disappeared through a side door.

The most solemn moment was at hand. They were to proceed immediately to
the election. The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and
black on their fingers.

Levin did not care to eat

white trousers and his court uniform

“I ought to own that I don’t very well understand the drift of the
provincial elections

The landowner looked at him.

“Why
It’s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of
inertia. Just look
justices of the peace
not of noblemen.”

“Then why do you come?” asked Levin.

“From habit
It’s a moral obligation of a sort. And then
one’s own interests. My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent
member; they’re not rich people
gentlemen

“That’s the new generation of nobility.”

“New it may be
but we’re the landowners. As noblemen

“But you say it’s an institution that’s served its time.”

“That it may be

“Oh

“Yes

I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service. Now I do more
work than I did in the service

“Then why do you do it

“Oh
it’s how it should be. And what’s more
his elbows on the window and chatting on
no taste for it. There’s no doubt he’ll be a scientific man. So
there’ll be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it. Here this year
I’ve planted an orchard.”

“Yes
no real balance of gain in my work on the land
It’s a sort of duty one feels to the land.”

“But I tell you what

worth something. I’d cut down the lot.’”

“And with what he made he’d increase his stock

He had evidently more than once come across those commercial
calculations. “And he’d make his fortune. But you and I must thank God
if we keep what we’ve got and leave it to our children.”

“You’re married

“Yes
strange

The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.

“There are some among us

but making away with capital on it.”

“But why is it we don’t do like the merchants? Why don’t we cut down
our parks for timber?” said Levin
struck him.

“Why
nobleman. And our work as noblemen isn’t done here at the elections
but yonder
one ought and oughtn’t to do. There’s the peasants
them sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.
However bad the land is
simple loss.”

“Just as we do
added

“And here we’ve met for the first time since we met at your place
said the landowner to Sviazhsky

“Well
with a smile.

“That we’re bound to do.”

“You’ve relieved your feelings?”


Chapter 30

Sviazhsky took Levin’s arm

This time there was no avoiding Vronsky. He was standing with Stepan
Arkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch
drew near.

“Delighted! I believe I’ve had the pleasure of meeting you ... at
Princess Shtcherbatskaya’s

“Yes
he turned away immediately

With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky
without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with
Levin. But Levin
round at Vronsky
over his rudeness.

“What are we waiting for now?” asked Levin
Vronsky.

“For Snetkov. He has to refuse or to consent to stand
Sviazhsky.

“Well

“That’s the point

“And if he refuses

“Whoever chooses to

“Certainly not I

“Who then? Nevyedovsky?” said Levin
into it.

But this was worse still. Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two
candidates.

This was Nevyedovsky himself. Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.

“Well

“Yes

“What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is! Sees it all so clearly.”

“Oh

“How is it that you
justice of the peace? You are not in the uniform of one.”

“It’s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly

“I don’t think so

“It’s a plaything

years. And what I have had was decided wrongly by them. The justice of

I should have to send a lawyer

And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller
when the miller told him of it
this was utterly uncalled for and stupid
he said it.

“Oh

And they separated.

“I can’t understand
brother’s clumsiness
absolutely devoid of political tact. That’s where we Russians are so
deficient. The marshal of the province is our opponent
you’re _ami cochon_
I’m not making a friend of him; he’s asked me to dinner
going; but he’s one of our side—why make an enemy of him? Then you ask
Nevyedovsky if he’s going to stand. That’s not a thing to do.”

“Oh

“You say it’s all such nonsense

Levin did not answer

captain of the guards
balloted for as marshal of the province.

The district marshals walked carrying plates
their tables to the high table

“Put it in the right side
brother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table. But
Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to
him
“the right side.” Surely Snetkov was the enemy. As he went up
the ball in his right hand
he changed to the left hand
An adept in the business
action of the elbow where each put his ball
was no good for him to use his insight.

Everything was still

marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority. All was noise
and eager movement towards the doors. Snetkov came in
thronged round him

“Well

“It’s only just beginning
Ivanovitch with a smile. “Some other candidate may receive more votes
than the marshal.”

Levin had quite forgotten about that. Now he could only remember that
there was some sort of trickery in it
what it was exactly. He felt depressed
crowd.

As no one was paying any attention to him

refreshments were
the waiters. The little old waiter pressed him to have something
Levin agreed. After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the
waiters of their former masters

leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of
what was being said below. With the ladies were sitting and standing

“How glad I am I heard Koznishev! It’s worth losing one’s dinner. He’s
exquisite! So clear and distinct all of it! There’s not one of you in
the law courts that speaks like that. The only one is Meidel
not so eloquent by a long way.”

Finding a free place
looking and listening.

All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to
their districts. In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform
who shouted in a loud

“As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we
call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!” A dead silence
followed

“We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol

“Declined!” a high boyish voice replied.

Again it began
hour. Levin
first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure
that he could not make it out he began to be bored. Then recalling all
the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces
sad; he made up his mind to go
through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy
walking up and down with tired-looking eyes. On the stairs he met a
couple—a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy
prosecutor.

The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky
stoutly denied all idea of standing. Levin went up to the door of the
room; it was locked. The secretary knocked

“I can’t stand any more of it

After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out. His
face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.

“I told you not to let anyone out!” he cried to the doorkeeper.

“I let someone in

“Mercy on us!” and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked
with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room
legs staggering in his white trousers.

Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority
was the new marshal of the province. Many people were amused
pleased and happy
unhappy. The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair
which he could not conceal. When Nevyedovsky went out of the room
crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically
they had followed the governor who had opened the meetings
they had followed Snetkov when he was elected.


Chapter 31

The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that
day with Vronsky.

Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the
country and wanted to show Anna his right to independence
repay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he
had taken for Vronsky at the district council election
order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner
which he had taken upon himself. But he had not in the least expected
that the election would so interest him
he would be so good at this kind of thing. He was quite a new man in
the circle of the nobility of the province
unmistakable
obtained a certain influence. This influence was due to his wealth and
reputation
Shirkov
of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought
from the country
schoolfellow of Vronsky’s—a schoolfellow he had patronized and
protected indeed. But what contributed more than all to his success was
his direct
majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed
haughtiness. He was himself conscious that

spiteful fury

Nevyedovsky. And now at his own table

success of his candidate. The election itself had so fascinated him
that
years
race ridden by a jockey

Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey. Vronsky sat at the
head of the table
of high rank. To all the rest he was the chief man in the province
had solemnly opened the elections with his speech
feeling of respect and even of awe in many people
Vronsky he was little Katka Maslov—that had been his nickname in the
Pages’ Corps—whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre à son aise_.
On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful
malignant face. With him Vronsky was simple and deferential.

Sviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly. It was indeed no
failure in his eyes
Nevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the
new movement
person
rejoicing over it.

Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad
that everyone was pleased. The episode of the elections served as a
good occasion for a capital dinner. Sviazhsky comically imitated the
tearful discourse of the marshal
that his excellency would have to select another more complicated
method of auditing the accounts than tears. Another nobleman jocosely
described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal’s
ball
marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.

Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: “our marshal
“your excellency.”

This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called
“Madame” and her husband’s name. Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely
indifferent but scornful of this appellation
he was highly delighted
betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.

After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the
result of the election. And Stepan Arkadyevitch
humor
twenty votes. Congratulations. Tell people.” He dictated it aloud
saying: “We must let them share our rejoicing.” Darya Alexandrovna
getting the message
understood that it was an after-dinner affair. She knew Stiva had a
weakness after dining for _faire jouer le télégraphe._



Everything

Vronsky was satisfied. He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone
in the provinces.

Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively. The governor asked
Vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his
wife

“There’ll be a ball

“Not in my line

Before they rose from the table
Vronsky’s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray.

The letter was from Anna. Before he read the letter

promised to be back on Friday. Today was Saturday

letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her
yet.

The letter was what he had expected
and particularly disagreeable to him. “Annie is very ill

The innocent festivities over the election
love to which he had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast. But he
had to go

Before Vronsky’s departure for the elections

him—for that she wanted nothing more than his love—but to be nearer to

the subject.

she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of
him and of what he was doing there
was taken ill. Anna began to look after her

hard she tried
was beyond her powers. Towards the evening of that day
Anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the
town
Vronsky received
special messenger. The next morning she received his letter and
regretted her own. She dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had
flung at her at parting
dangerously ill. But still she was glad she had written to him. At this
moment Anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden
to him

She was sitting in the drawing-room near a lamp

every minute expecting the carriage to arrive. Several times she had
fancied she heard the sound of wheels

the dull rumble in the covered entry. Even Princess Varvara

of going down
suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity
he might meet her. All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was
only afraid of the expression of his displeasure. She remembered that
her child had been perfectly well again for the last two days. She felt
positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her
letter was sent off. Then she thought of him

“Well

taking her eyes off him.

“Well

The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess

his absence.

“What am I to do? I couldn’t sleep.... My thoughts prevented me. When
he’s here I never take it—hardly ever.”

He told her about the election
to bring him to what gave him most pleasure—his own success. She told
him of everything that interested him at home; and all that she told
him was of the most cheerful description.

But late in the evening
had regained complete possession of him
impression of the glance he had given her for her letter. She said:

“Tell me frankly

As soon as she had said it

“Yes
you thought of coming yourself.”

“It was all the truth.”

“Oh

“Yes

“Not for one moment. I’m only vexed
unwilling to admit that there are duties....”

“The duty of going to a concert....”

“But we won’t talk about it

“Why not talk about it?” she said.

“I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up. Now

“You talk as if you were threatening me. But I desire nothing so much

She was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love

was the only way she could define his condition to herself. Sometimes
she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town;
sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his
life here so that he could be satisfied with it.

What had he to do
a club. Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky’s type—she
knew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere
after drinking. She could not think without horror of where men went on
such occasions. Was he to go into society? But she knew he could only
find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young
women
her
their conversations forever on the same subjects—“Aline-Nadine
old prince called the sisters’ talks—she knew it must bore him. What
was there left for him to do? To go on writing at his book he had
indeed attempted
extracts and look up references for his book. But
more he did nothing
he complained that he had talked too much about his book here
consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their
interest for him.

One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened
between them here in town. Whether it was that their conditions were
different

had so dreaded when they moved from the country.

The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was
that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the
features once so familiar to her

But this lasted only a few seconds. Before her father
began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky
perfectly ready to look at Vronsky
exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna
to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and
smile would have been approved by her husband

She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their
meeting Vronsky

pleased with herself. She had not expected she would have had the
power

“I am very sorry you weren’t there

The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself

to Stiva. It’s really unbearable. One can’t speak to papa about it....
But if you and he....”

“Why

“You’ll be at Arseny’s
decided.”

“Oh
him. By the way
good-bye.”

On the steps Levin was stopped by his old servant Kouzma
with him before his marriage
town.

“Beauty” (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country)
“has been badly shod and is quite lame
wish to be done?”

During the first part of their stay in Moscow
horses brought up from the country. He had tried to arrange this part
of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it
appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses
still hired too.

“Send for the veterinary

“And for Katerina Alexandrovna?” asked Kouzma.

Levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to
get from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful
horses put into a heavy carriage
through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours
paying five roubles every time.

Now it seemed quite natural.

“Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster

“Yes

And so
settled a question which
personal trouble and exertion
a sledge
more of money
Petersburg savant
about his book.

Only during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck
by the expenditure
but inevitable
had grown used to it. That had happened to him in this matter which is
said to happen to drunkards—the first glass sticks in the throat
second flies down like a hawk
little birds. When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to
pay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help
reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone—but they were
indubitably necessary
Kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries
liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer
would pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash
Wednesday
evening—and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat. But the
next note
that cost twenty-eight roubles
reflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats
men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and
winnowed and sifted and sown
And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections
they flew off like little birds. Whether the labor devoted to obtaining
the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with
it
calculation that there was a certain price below which he could not
sell certain grain was forgotten too. The rye
he had so long held out
cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago. Even the consideration
that with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year
without debt
have money in the bank
know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow. And this
condition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always had the money in
the bank. But now the money in the bank had gone
quite tell where to get the next installment. And this it was which
the moment when Kitty had mentioned money
had no time to think about it. He drove off
the meeting with Metrov that was before him.


Chapter 3

Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at
the university
marriage. He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his
conception of life. Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov’s
conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov
thought that the disconnectedness of Levin’s ideas was due to his lack
of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov’s clearness
and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin’s untrained ideas
they liked to meet and to discuss.

Levin had read Katavasov some parts of his book
On the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and
told him that the celebrated Metrov
liked
Katavasov had told him about Levin’s work
see him tomorrow at eleven
acquaintance.

“You’re positively a reformed character
Katavasov
and thought: Impossible that it can be he at the exact time!... Well
what do you say to the Montenegrins now? They’re a race of warriors.”

“Why

Katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war
and going into his study
pleasant appearance. This was Metrov. The conversation touched for a
brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the
higher spheres in Petersburg. Metrov repeated a saying that had reached
him through a most trustworthy source
on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers. Katavasov had
heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something
quite different. Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both
sayings might have been uttered
dropped.

“Yes
laborer in relation to the land
specialist
taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but
contrary
dependence seeking the laws of his development.”

“That’s very interesting

“What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but
studying the chief instrument of agriculture
reddening

And Levin began carefully
his views. He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally
accepted theory of political economy
reckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could
not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.

“But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian
laborer?” said Metrov; “in his biological characteristics
or in the condition in which he is placed?”

Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he
did not agree. But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian
laborer has a quite special view of the land
other people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that
in his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the
consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the
East.

“One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the
general vocation of a people
condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land
and to capital.”

And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea
expounding to him the special point of his own theory.

In what the point of his theory lay
he did not take the trouble to understand. He saw that Metrov
other people
current theory of political economy
Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital
rent. He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the
eastern—much the larger—part of Russia rent was as yet nil
nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took
the form simply of food provided for themselves
not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools. Yet it
was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer
though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own
theory of the wage-fund

Levin listened reluctantly
liked to interrupt Metrov
opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov’s theories
superfluous. But later on
matter so differently
did not even oppose his statements
Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him
experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him. It flattered
his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so
eagerly
the subject
of the subject. He put this down to his own credit

deliver an address on his labors in zoology. Come along with us

“Yes
from there
to hear your work.”

“Oh
go to the meeting.”

“I say
Katavasov called from the other room
coat.

And a conversation sprang up upon the university question
very important event that winter in Moscow. Three old professors in the
council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors. The
young ones had registered a separate resolution. This
of some people
simplest and most just thing to do
into two parties.

One party
scoundrelly betrayal and treachery
them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities. Levin
though he did not belong to the university
during his stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter
his own opinion on the subject. He took part in the conversation that
was continued in the street
of the old university.

The meeting had already begun. Round the cloth-covered table
Katavasov and Metrov seated themselves
persons
something aloud. Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were
standing round the table
what was being read. The student

“Biography.”

Though Levin was not interested in the biography
listening
the distinguished man of science.

When the reader had finished
verses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee
by way of thanks to the poet. Then Katavasov in his loud
read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was
being kept.

When Katavasov had finished
one
read Metrov his book
the reading he had thought over their conversation. He saw distinctly
now that though Metrov’s ideas might perhaps have value
had a value too
something if each worked separately in his chosen path
nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together. And having
made up his mind to refuse Metrov’s invitation
the end of the meeting. Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman
whom he was talking of the political news. Metrov told the chairman
what he had already told Levin
news that he had already made that morning
he expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him. After
that the conversation turned again on the university question. As Levin
had already heard it all
sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation
drove to Lvov’s.

In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the
fact that Lvov was older than Levin

Lvov was at home

His handsome

lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.

“Capital! I was meaning to send to you. How’s Kitty? Sit here
more comfortable.” He got up and pushed up a rocking chair. “Have you
read the last circular in the _Journal de St. Pétersbourg?_ I think
it’s excellent

Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in
Petersburg
his interview with Metrov
it was very interesting.

“That’s what I envy you

My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I’m not
ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.”

“That I don’t believe

sincere.

“Oh

to study myself. For it’s not enough to have teachers
someone to look after them

the desk—“it’s expected of Misha

Levin tried to explain to him that it couldn’t be understood
it had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.

“Oh

“On the contrary

“Well

“All I know

Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight

“If only they’re better than I! That’s all I desire. You don’t know yet
all the work
wild abroad.”

“You’ll catch all that up. They’re such clever children. The great
thing is the education of character. That’s what I learn when I look at
your children.”

“You talk of the education of character. You can’t imagine how
difficult that is! You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency
when others crop up
support in religion—you remember we talked about that—no father could
bring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.”

And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the
day. As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business
while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a
committee on the Eastern Question
and settle. Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.
It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the

Chapter 5

At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were
performed. One was a fantasia
dedicated to the memory of Bach. Both were new and in the new style
and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them. After escorting his
sister-in-law to her stall
listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible. He tried not to
let his attention be distracted
looking at the conductor in a white tie
disturbed his enjoyment of music so much
with strings carefully tied over their ears
either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things
except the music. He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or
talkative acquaintances
him

But the more he listened to the fantasia of _King Lear_ the further he
felt from forming any definite opinion of it. There was
continual beginning
feeling
musical motives
exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds. And these fragmentary
musical expressions
because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.
Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one
another without any connection
those emotions

During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching
people dancing
fantasia was over
on his attention. Loud applause resounded on all sides. Everyone got
up
own perplexity from the impressions of others
about
musical amateur in conversation with Pestsov

“Marvelous!” Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass. “How are you
Konstantin Dmitrievitch? Particularly sculpturesque and plastic
say
approach
fate. Isn’t it?”

“You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?” Levin asked timidly
forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.

“Cordelia comes in ... see here!” said Pestsov
the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to
Levin.

Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia
to read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were
printed on the back of the program.

“You can’t follow it without that
the person he had been speaking to had gone away
talk to.

In the _entr’acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the
merits and defects of music of the Wagner school. Levin maintained that
the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take
music into the sphere of another art
tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do
instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble
certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the
pedestal. “These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they
were positively clinging on the ladder
pleased him
phrase before

Pestsov maintained that art is one
manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.

The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear. Pestsov
was standing beside him
condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of
simplicity
in painting. As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances
whom he talked of politics
Among others he met Count Bol
upon.

“Well
they’ll not be at home
me. You’ll find me still there.”


Chapter 6

“Perhaps they’re not at home?” said Levin
Countess Bola’s house.

“At home; please walk in
overcoat.

“How annoying!” thought Levin with a sigh
stroking his hat. “What did I come for? What have I to say to them?”

As he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway

“How is your wife? Have you been at the concert? We couldn’t go. Mamma
had to be at the funeral service.”

“Yes

The countess came in

Levin answered

“But she was always in weak health.”

“Were you at the opera yesterday?”

“Yes

“Lucca was very good.”

“Yes

hundred times about the characteristics of the singer’s talent.
Countess Bola pretended to be listening. Then
and paused
The colonel too talked of the opera
speaking of the proposed _folle journée_ at Turin’s
laughed
the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go. He
must stay two minutes longer. He sat down.

But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was
find a subject for conversation

“You are not going to the public meeting? They say it will be very
interesting

“No

A silence followed. The mother once more exchanged glances with a
daughter.

“Well
The ladies shook hands with him
to his wife for them.

The porter asked him
staying?” and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely
bound book.

“Of course I don’t care
thought Levin
it. He drove to the public meeting
sister-in-law

At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people
and almost all the highest society. Levin was in time for the report
which
report was over
invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the
Society of Agriculture
and Stepan Arkadyevitch

criticisms on the meeting

Levin reached the club just at the right time. Members and visitors
were driving up as he arrived. Levin had not been at the club for a
very long while—not since he lived in Moscow
university and going into society. He remembered the club
details of its arrangement
impression it had made on him in old days. But as soon as
the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge
the steps
noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the
porter’s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less
trouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he heard the mysterious
ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy
staircase
the top doors
opening the door without haste or delay
they passed in—Levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a
rush

“Your hat
to leave his hat in the porter’s room. “Long time since you’ve been.
The prince put your name down yesterday. Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is
not here yet.”

The porter did not only know Levin
relationships

Passing through the outer hall
partitioned on the right
overtook an old man walking slowly in
of noise and people.

He walked along the tables
visitors. He saw people of all sorts
little
worried-looking face. All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties
in the porter’s room with their hats
ready to enjoy the material blessings of life. Sviazhsky was here and
Shtcherbatsky
Ivanovitch.

“Ah! why are you late?” the prince said smiling
hand over his own shoulder. “How’s Kitty?” he added
napkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons.

“All right; they are dining at home

“Ah

“Levin
was Turovtsin. He was sitting with a young officer
were two chairs turned upside down. Levin gladly went up to them. He
had always liked the good-hearted rake
his mind with memories of his courtship—and at that moment
strain of intellectual conversation
good-natured face was particularly welcome.

“For you and Oblonsky. He’ll be here directly.”

The young man
with enjoyment
introduced them.

“Oblonsky’s always late.”

“Ah

“Have you only just come?” said Oblonsky
“Good day. Had some vodka? Well

Levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and
appetizers of the most various kinds. One would have thought that out
of two dozen delicacies one might find something to one’s taste
Stepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special

“You met him once at my place

Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.

Stepan Arkadyevitch’s anecdote too was very amusing. Levin told his

Vronsky’s Atlas had won the first prize. Levin did not notice how the
time passed at dinner.

“Ah! and here they are!” Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards the end of
dinner
Vronsky
too beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment that was general in
the club. He propped his elbow playfully on Stepan Arkadyevitch’s
shoulder

“How _shlupiks_?”

“I see you don’t know that name. That’s our club designation. You know
the game of rolling eggs: when one’s rolled a long while it becomes a
_shlupik_. So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club
and ends by becoming a _shlupik_. Ah
fear of dropping into it ourselves. You know Prince Tchetchensky?”
inquired the prince; and Levin saw by his face that he was just going
to relate something funny.

“No

“You don’t say so! Well

Vronsky sat down at the table
incessantly coming up to him. Every now and then he went to the
“infernal” to keep an eye on Yashvin. Levin was enjoying a delightful
sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning. He was glad
that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky

“Oblonsky’s carriage!” the porter shouted in an angry bass. The

“Where are they?”

“In the study.”

Passing through the dining-room

dark shade. Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall
lighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman
not help looking at. It was the portrait of Anna
Mihailov. While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the _treillage_
the man’s voice which had been speaking paused

on it
where he was
eyes off the marvelous portrait. It was not a picture
charming woman
with a pensive smile on the lips
and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him. She was not
living only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be.

“I am delighted!” He heard suddenly near him a voice
addressing him

Levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait
in a dark blue shot gown

caught in the portrait. She was less dazzling in reality

which was not in the portrait.


Chapter 10

She had risen to meet him
and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand
introduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired
girl who was sitting at work
and liked the manners of a woman of the great world
self-possessed and natural.

“I am delighted
words took for Levin’s ears a special significance. “I have known you
and liked you for a long while
and for your wife’s sake.... I knew her for a very short time
left on me the impression of an exquisite flower
to think she will soon be a mother!”

She spoke easily and without haste
her brother
and he felt immediately at home
he had known her from childhood.

“Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey’s study
to Stepan Arkadyevitch’s question whether he might smoke
to be able to smoke”—and glancing at Levin
he would smoke
a cigarette.

“How are you feeling today?” her brother asked her.

“Oh

“Yes
noticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.

“I have never seen a better portrait.”

“And extraordinarily like

Levin looked from the portrait to the original. A peculiar brilliance
lighted up Anna’s face when she felt his eyes on her. Levin flushed
and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen Darya
Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke. “We were just
talking
you seen them?”

“Yes

“But

Levin asked if she had seen Dolly lately.

“She was here yesterday. She was very indignant with the high school
people on Grisha’s account. The Latin teacher
unfair to him.”

“Yes
Levin went back to the subject she had started.

Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to
the subject with which he had been talking all the morning. Every word
in his conversation with her had a special significance. And talking to
her was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.

Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly
carelessly
to the ideas of the person she was talking to.

The conversation turned on the new movement in art
illustrations of the Bible by a French artist. Vorkuev attacked the
artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.

Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than
anyone
realism. In the fact of not lying they see poetry.

Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as
this remark. Anna’s face lighted up at once
the thought. She laughed.

“I laugh
What you said so perfectly hits off French art now
literature too
men form their conceptions from fictitious
then—all the _combinaisons_ made—they are tired of the fictitious
figures and begin to invent more natural

“That’s perfectly true

“So you’ve been at the club?” she said to her brother.

“Yes
staring persistently at her lovely
was all at once completely transformed. Levin did not hear what she was
talking of as she leaned over to her brother
change of her expression. Her face—so handsome a moment before in its
repose—suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity
this lasted only an instant. She dropped her eyelids
recollecting something.

“Oh
turned to the English girl.

“Please order the tea in the drawing-room

The girl got up and went out.

“Well
Arkadyevitch.

“Splendidly! She’s a very gifted child and a sweet character.”

“It will end in your loving her more than your own.”

“There a man speaks. In love there’s no more nor less. I love my
daughter with one love

“I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna
to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl
to the public question of the education of Russian children
be doing a great and useful work.”

“Yes
urged me very much” (as she uttered the words _Count Alexey
Kirillovitch_ she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin
unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look); “he
urged me to take up the school in the village. I visited it several
times. The children were very nice
work. You speak of energy. Energy rests upon love; and come as it will
there’s no forcing it. I took to this child—I could not myself say
why.”

And she glanced again at Levin. And her smile and her glance—all told
him that it was to him only she was addressing her words
good opinion
each other.

“I quite understand that
one’s heart to a school or such institutions in general
that’s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor
results.”

She was silent for a while

“Yes
large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls. _Cela ne m’a
jamais réussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une
position sociale_ in that way. And now more than ever
mournful
unmistakably intending her words only for Levin
need of some occupation
that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself) she changed
the subject. “I know about you
public-spirited citizen
ability.”

“How have you defended me?”

“Oh
tea?” She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.

“Give it to me
“It’s well worth taking up.”

“Oh

“I told him about it
at Levin.

“You shouldn’t have. My writing is something after the fashion of those
little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from
the prisons. She had the direction of the prison department in that
society
work of those poor wretches.”

And Levin saw a new trait in this woman
extraordinarily. Besides wit
no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position. As she
said that she sighed
looked as it were turned to stone. With that expression on her face she
was more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was
utterly unlike that expression
happiness
looked more than once at the portrait and at her figure
brother’s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her
a tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself.

She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing-room
stayed behind to say a few words to her brother. “About her divorce
about Vronsky
Levin. And he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was
saying to Stepan Arkadyevitch
telling him of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna
had written.

At tea the same pleasant sort of talk
continued. There was not a single instant when a subject for
conversation was to seek; on the contrary
hardly time to say what one had to say
what the others were saying. And all that was said
but by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch—all
gained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism.
While he followed this interesting conversation
admiring her—her beauty
time her directness and genuine depth of feeling. He listened and
talked
divine her feelings. And though he had judged her so severely hitherto
now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was
also sorry for her

Regretfully Levin too rose.

“Good-bye

She dropped his hand

“Certainly

Still thinking of Anna
their conversation with her
expression
sympathy for her



At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well
and that her sisters had not long been gone
letters. Levin read them at once in the hall
overlook them later. One was from Sokolov
that the corn could not be sold
half roubles
other letter was from his sister. She scolded him for her business
being still unsettled.

“Well
decided the first question
weighty one
extraordinary how all one’s time is taken up here
considering the second letter. He felt himself to blame for not having
got done what his sister had asked him to do for her. “Today

enough

thing” in the tender sympathy he was feeling for Anna.

Levin found his wife low-spirited and dull. The dinner of the three
sisters had gone off very well

been left alone.

“Well
into his eyes
that she might not prevent his telling her everything
her close scrutiny of him
account of how he had spent the evening.

“Well
with him. You understand
this awkwardness is all over

blushed. “We talk about the peasants drinking; I don’t know which
drinks most
holidays

But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking
habits of the peasants. She saw that he blushed
why.

“Well

“Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.”

And as he said this
whether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for
all. He knew now that he ought not to have done so.

Kitty’s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna’s name
controlling herself with an effort
deceived him.

“Oh!” was all she said.

“I’m sure you won’t be angry at my going. Stiva begged me to

“Oh
no good.

“She is a very sweet

Coming back
her

“What? what is it?” he asked

“You’re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you! I saw
it in your eyes. Yes
at the club
people! No

It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife. At last he
succeeded in calming her
conjunction with the wine he had drunk
he had succumbed to Anna’s artful influence
her. One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so
long in Moscow
drinking

able to go to sleep.


Chapter 12

After taking leave of her guests
walking up and down the room. She had unconsciously the whole evening
done her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love—as of late she had
fallen into doing with all young men—and she knew she had attained her
aim
conscientious man. She liked him indeed extremely
striking difference
and Levin
made Kitty able to love both. Yet as soon as he was out of the room
she ceased to think of him.

One thought
to be shaken off. “If I have so much effect on others
loves his home and his wife
cold exactly
apart now. Why wasn’t he here all the evening? He told Stiva to say he
could not leave Yashvin
child? But supposing it’s true. He never tells a lie. But there’s
something else in it if it’s true. He is glad of an opportunity of
showing me that he has other duties; I know that
why prove that to me? He wants to show me that his love for me is not
to interfere with his freedom. But I need no proofs
ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in
Moscow. Is this life? I am not living

cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch. And I can’t write again. I can do
nothing

He ought to feel for me
into her eyes.

She heard Vronsky’s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears—not only
dried her tears

not come home as he had promised—displeased only

“Well
going up to her. “What a terrible passion it is—gambling!”

“No
has been here and Levin.”

“Yes
said

“Very much. They have not long been gone. What was Yashvin doing?”

“He was winning—seventeen thousand. I got him away. He had really
started home

“Then what did you stay for?” she asked
him. The expression of her face was cold and ungracious. “You told
Stiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away. And you have left him
there.”

The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his
face too.

“In the first place
secondly
stay
you?” he said after a moment’s silence
he opened his hand

She was glad of this appeal for tenderness. But some strange force of
evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings
rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender.

“Of course you wanted to stay
want to. But what do you tell me that for? With what object?” she said
getting more and more excited. “Does anyone contest your rights? But
you want to be right

His hand closed

“For you it’s a matter of obstinacy

“But what are you talking about?” he said

There are no conditions to which a man cannot become used
if he sees that all around him are living in the same way. Levin could
not have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly
to sleep in the condition in which he was that day

wife had once been in love

that woman and causing his wife distress—he could still go quietly to
sleep. But under the influence of fatigue
wine he had drunk

At five o’clock the creak of a door opening waked him. He jumped up and
looked round. Kitty was not in bed beside him. But there was a light
moving behind the screen

The candle was lighted again. She was sitting up in bed
knitting

“Please

He hurriedly jumped up
as he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped

Though there was so little that was complex or artificial in Kitty’s
character in general

shone in her eyes. And in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul

“Well

And Levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she
had brought in in the night and begun working at it again.

As Levin was going out of one door

She looked at him

He had just gone into the drawing-room

“Yes

“Lord have mercy on us! pardon us! aid us!” he repeated the words that
for some reason came suddenly to his lips. And he
repeated these words not with his lips only. At that instant he knew

“So you think that it may go on well? Lord have mercy on us and help

The doctor was not yet up

At the chemist’s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a

time; that he would certainly not be angry! and that he must therefore
wake him at once.

The footman agreed

Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing

that more than an hour had gone by. He could not wait any longer.

been going on more than two hours already.”

“In a minute; in a minute!” answered a voice
Levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke.

“For one instant.”

“In a minute.”

Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots
two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair.

“Pyotr Dmitrievitch!” Levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice
just as the doctor came in dressed and ready. “These people have no
conscience

“Good morning!” the doctor said to him
teasing him with his composure. “There’s no hurry. Well now?”

Trying to be as accurate as possible
unnecessary detail of his wife’s condition
repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once.

“Oh
certain I’m not wanted
come. But there’s no hurry. Please sit down; won’t you have some
coffee?”

Levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at
him; but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him.

“I know
and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied. I’ve a
patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such
occasions.”

“But what do you think
all right?”

“Everything points to a favorable issue.”

“So you’ll come immediately?” said Levin
servant who was bringing in the coffee.

“In an hour’s time.”

“Oh

“Well

The doctor started upon his coffee. Both were silent.

“The Turks are really getting beaten

“No

“In half an hour.”

“On your honor?”

When Levin got home
they went up to the bedroom door together. The princess had tears in
her eyes

From the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on

But after that hour there passed another hour

because there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling

sent to the study to ask the doctor something. The doctor had answered
and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal
council. Then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess
to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting

compassionately at him

the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered
him a drop of something.

All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened
nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed
of his brother Nikolay. But that had been grief—this was joy. Yet that
grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of
life; they were loop-holes
which there came glimpses of something sublime. And in the
contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to
inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception

He did not know whether it was late or early. The candles had all
burned out. Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the
doctor that he should lie down. Levin sat listening to the doctor’s
stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his
cigarette. There had been a period of repose
oblivion. He had completely forgotten what was going on now. He heard
the doctor’s chat and understood it. Suddenly there came an unearthly
shriek. The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up
holding his breath
doctor put his head on one side
Everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as
strange. “I suppose it must be so

had no wish to see or comprehend. But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta
Petrovna. Lizaveta Petrovna’s face was stern and pale
resolute
intently on Kitty. Kitty’s swollen and agonized face
clinging to her moist brow
lifted hands asked for his hands. Clutching his chill hands in her
moist ones

“Don’t go

Beside himself
face of Lizaveta Petrovna. It was even more frowning and stern. Kitty’s
face he did not know. In the place where it had been was something that
was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from
it. He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed
feeling that his heart was bursting. The awful scream never paused
became still more awful
of terror
there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued
stir and bustle

He lifted his head. With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt

long they prevented him from speaking.

Falling on his knees before the bed

lay the life of a human creature
which would now with the same right

Lizaveta Petrovna saying

The princess’s sobs were all the answers she could make. And in the
midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother’s
question
It was the bold
being

If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead
with her
standing before him
coming back to the world of reality
efforts to take in that she was alive and well
squalling so desperately was his son. Kitty was alive
over. And he was unutterably happy. That he understood; he was
completely happy in it. But the baby? Whence
could not get used to the idea. It seemed to him something extraneous
superfluous


Chapter 16

At ten o’clock the old prince
Arkadyevitch were sitting at Levin’s. Having inquired after Kitty
had dropped into conversation upon other subjects. Levin heard them
and unconsciously
been up to that morning
till that point. It was as though a hundred years had passed since
then. He felt himself exalted to unattainable heights
studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking
to. He talked
condition now
himself into believing. The whole world of woman
him since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before
now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination. He
heard them talk of yesterday’s dinner at the club

thinking of? Is he crying

could not answer

“I have had a nap

She looked at him

nothing towards it but disgust. But when it was undressed and he caught
a glimpse of wee

Lizaveta Petrovna laughed.

“Don’t be frightened

When the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll
Lizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork
stood a little away so that Levin might see his son in all his glory.

Kitty looked sideways in the same direction
the baby. “Give him to me! give him to me!” she said
though she would sit up.

“What are you thinking of
that! Wait a minute. I’ll give him to you. Here we’re showing papa what
a fine fellow we are!”

And Lizaveta Petrovna
lifted up on the other arm the strange

eyes and smacking lips.

“A splendid baby!” said Lizaveta Petrovna.

Levin sighed with mortification. This splendid baby excited in him no
feeling but disgust and compassion. It was not at all the feeling he
had looked forward to.

He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed
breast.

Suddenly laughter made him look round. The baby had taken the breast.

“Come

“Look

sneezed.

went out of the dark room. What he felt towards this little creature
was utterly unlike what he had expected. There was nothing cheerful and
joyous in the feeling; on the contrary
apprehension. It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to
pain. And this sense was so painful at first
this helpless creature should suffer was so intense
him from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride
that he had felt when the baby sneezed.


Chapter 17

Stepan Arkadyevitch’s affairs were in a very bad way.

The money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already
he had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount
almost all the remaining third. The merchant would not give more
especially as Darya Alexandrovna
insisting on her right to her own property
receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest. All his salary
went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not
be put off. There was positively no money.

This was unpleasant and awkward
things could not go on like this. The explanation of the position was
in his view
post he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago
was so no longer.

Petrov
director
received fifty thousand.

“Clearly I’ve been napping
Arkadyevitch thought about himself. And he began keeping his eyes and
ears open
good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it
Moscow through aunts
was well advanced
one of those snug
nowadays than there used to be
to fifty thousand roubles. It was the post of secretary of the
committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways
certain banking companies. This position
called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications
was difficult for them to be found united in any one man. And since a
man combining all the qualifications was not to be found
least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest
man. And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest
man—unemphatically—in the common acceptation of the words
honest man—emphatically—in that special sense which the word has in
Moscow
an “honest” newspaper
meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest
but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in
opposition to the authorities.

Stepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that
expression had come into use
so had more right to this appointment than others.

The appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year
and Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position.
It was in the hands of two ministers
these people
Arkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg. Besides this business
Arkadyevitch had promised his sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a
definite answer on the question of divorce. And begging fifty roubles
from Dolly

Stepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin’s study listening to his report on
the causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance
waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own
business or about Anna.

“Yes

“Yes

passage in which this statement was made. And turning over the
beautifully written
read aloud over again the conclusive passage.

“I don’t advocate protection for the sake of private interests
the public weal
looking over his pince-nez at Oblonsky. “But _they_ cannot grasp that
_they_ are taken up now with personal interests
phrases.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what _they_
were doing and thinking
and were the cause of everything wrong in Russia
near the end. And so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of
free-trade
thoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript.

“Oh
time when you see Pomorsky
glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the
amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he
coveted

Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new
committee
would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been
advocating. But as the influence of the new committee was of a very
complex nature
not decide this straight off

“Of course
for wishing to obtain the appointment?”

“It’s a good salary

“Nine thousand!” repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch
high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side Stepan
Arkadyevitch’s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of
his own projects of reform

“I consider
that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound
economic _assiette_ of our finances.”

“But what’s to be done?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Suppose a bank
director gets ten thousand—well
twenty thousand—after all

“I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity
to conform with the law of supply and demand. If the salary is fixed
without any regard for that law

with two; or when I see lawyers and hussars

this is an abuse of great gravity in itself
injuriously on the government service. I consider....”

Stepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law.

“Yes; but you must agree that it’s a new institution of undoubted
utility that’s being started. After all
thing! What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on
honestly

But the Moscow significance of the word “honest” was lost on Alexey
Alexandrovitch.

“Honesty is only a negative qualification

“Well
“by putting in a word to Pomorsky—just in the way of conversation....”

“But I fancy it’s more in Volgarinov’s hands
Alexandrovitch.

“Volgarinov has fully assented
Arkadyevitch
of that name
and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection.

Stepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in
which he was trying to get an appointment was a new
honest public body
beyond a doubt—kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his
waiting room

Whether he was uncomfortable that he

the first time in his life he was not following the example of his
ancestors in serving the government
career
Volgarinov’s waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch
the room
other petitioners
assiduously concealed from others
he was experiencing.

But all the time he was uncomfortable and angry
why—whether because he could not get his epigram just right
some other reason. When at last Volgarinov had received him with
exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation
had all but refused the favor asked of him
made haste to forget it all as soon as possible. And now

“Now there is something I want to talk about
About Anna
shaking off the unpleasant impression.

As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna’s name
Alexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of
it

“What is it exactly that you want from me?” he said

with difficulty

“She leaves it all to your generosity. She begs
of you—to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is
placed. She does not ask for her son now. Alexey Alexandrovitch

“So you go back from your promise?”

“I have never refused to do all that is possible

“No

you?) who forgave everything

Stepan Arkadyevitch was about to go away when Korney came in to
announce:

“Sergey Alexyevitch!”

“Who’s Sergey Alexyevitch?” Stepan Arkadyevitch was beginning

“Ah

Petersburg
appointment
said

In spite of its _cafés chantants_ and its omnibuses
stagnant bog. Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it. After living for some
time in Moscow
conscious of a depression of spirits. After being a long time in Moscow
without a change
worrying himself over his wife’s ill-humor and reproaches
children’s health and education
work; even the fact of being in debt worried him. But he had only to go
and stay a little while in Petersburg
moved
Moscow
before the fire. His wife?... Only that day he had been talking to
Prince Tchetchensky. Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family
grown-up pages in the corps
of children also. Though the first family was very nice too
Tchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take his
eldest son with him to his second family
that he thought it good for his son
have been said to that in Moscow?

His children? In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from
enjoying life. The children were brought up in schools
no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow
household
children
people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself
every man of culture should live.

His official duties? Official work here was not the stiff
drudgery that it was in Moscow. Here there was some interest in
official life. A chance meeting
knack of facetious mimicry
trice. So it had been with Bryantsev
the previous day
government now. There was some interest in official work like that.

The Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing
effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch. Bartnyansky
fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in
interesting comment the day before on that subject.

As they were talking before dinner
Bartnyansky:

“You’re friendly
say a word to him
to get—secretary of the agency....”

“Oh
possesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?... Take it as you
will

Stepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a “growing
thing”—Bartnyansky would not have understood that.

“I want the money

“You’re living

“Yes

“Are you

“Very heavily: twenty thousand.”

Bartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.

“Oh
half

And Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words
only but in actual fact. Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand
hadn’t a farthing to bless himself with
too! Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone
he kept two mistresses. Petrovsky had run through five millions
still lived in just the same style
financial department with a salary of twenty thousand. But besides
this
Arkadyevitch. It made him younger. In Moscow he sometimes found a gray
hair in his head
upstairs
and did not dance at balls. In Petersburg he always felt ten years
younger.

His experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him
on the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky
just come back from abroad:

“We don’t know the way to live here
summer in Baden
At a glimpse of a pretty woman
glass of wine
Russia—had to see my wife
and there
dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner. Needn’t say I had no
thoughts left for pretty women. I became quite an old gentleman. There
was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation. I went
off to Paris—I was as right as could be at once.”

Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky
described. In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be
there for long together
considering his salvation; in Petersburg he felt himself a man of the
world again.

Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long
existed rather curious relations. Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted
with her in jest
unseemly things
after his conversation with Karenin
her
he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate
himself
thought her positively disagreeable. What made it hard to change the
conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her. So that
he was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya
cut short their _tête-à-tête_.

“Ah
of your poor sister? You needn’t look at me like that
“Ever since they’ve all turned against her
times worse than she
forgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg. I’d
have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere. Please give
her my love. Come

“Yes
Arkadyevitch
Princess Myakaya’s words “tell me about her.” Princess Myakaya
interrupted him immediately
herself.

“She’s done what they all do
wouldn’t be deceitful
still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours. You must
excuse me. Everybody used to say he was so clever
was the only one that said he was a fool. Now that he’s so thick with
Lidia Ivanovna and Landau
not to agree with everybody

“Oh
Yesterday I was seeing him on my sister’s behalf
give me a final answer. He gave me no answer
it over. But this morning
invitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this evening.”

“Ah
“they’re going to ask Landau what he’s to say.”

“Ask Landau? What for? Who or what’s Landau?”

clairvoyant_? He’s crazy too
See what comes of living in the provinces—you know nothing about
anything. Landau
went to a doctor’s; and in the doctor’s waiting room he fell asleep
and in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients. And
wonderful advice it was! Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky—you know
invalid?—heard of this Landau
cured her husband
for he’s just as feeble a creature as ever he was
him
there’s been a general rush to him
He cured Countess Bezzubova

“Adopted him?”

“Yes
That’s neither here nor there

Chapter 21

After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at
Bartnyansky’s
appointed time

“Who else is with the countess?—a Frenchman?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked
the hall-porter
Alexandrovitch and a queer
clasps.

“Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov

“Princess Myakaya guessed right
went upstairs. “Curious! It would be quite as well

word to Pomorsky

It was still quite light out-of-doors
little drawing-room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted. At a
round table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch
talking softly. A short
feminine hips and knock-kneed legs
hair lying on the collar of his coat
room gazing at the portraits on the wall. After greeting the lady of
the house and Alexey Alexandrovitch
resist glancing once more at the unknown man.

“Monsieur Landau!” the countess addressed him with a softness and
caution that impressed Oblonsky. And she introduced them.

Landau looked round hurriedly
lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s outstretched hand and
immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again. The
countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.

“I am very glad to see you
Ivanovna

“I introduced you to him as Landau
at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey Alexandrovitch
“but he is really Count Bezzubov
does not like the title.”

“Yes

“She was here today

her!”

“And he positively is going?” queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.

“Yes

“I’ve known you for a long while

a true friend
and I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey
Alexandrovitch. You understand what I mean?” she said
pensive eyes.

“In part
Alexandrovitch....” said Oblonsky. Having no clear idea what they were
talking about

“The change is not in his external position
said sternly
Alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau; “his heart is
changed
fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him.”

“Oh

with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess
mentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was
most intimate

“The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his
neighbors; on the contrary
heart. But I am afraid you do not understand me. Won’t you have some
tea?” she said
round tea on a tray.

“Not quite

“Yes

full of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them
Arkadyevitch.

“Oh

care to speak of them.”

“On the contrary! We ought to speak freely and help one another.”

“Yes

“There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.”

“Oh
confusion. He understood at last that they were talking of religion.

“I fancy he will fall asleep immediately

Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round. Landau was sitting at the window

“How anyone can be indifferent!” said Lidia Ivanovna.

“I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in

“I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.”

Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.

“We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not

“Do you allow me to listen?” he asked.

“Oh

discussed more than once before. “What harm has been done by the false

Chapter 22

Stepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk
which he was hearing for the first time. The complexity of Petersburg
as a rule
Moscow stagnation. But he liked these complications
them only in the circles he knew and was at home in. In these
unfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted
get his bearings. As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna
the beautiful
which—eyes of Landau fixed upon him
conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head.

The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head. “Marie Sanina
is glad her child’s dead.... How good a smoke would be now!... To be
saved
to be done
head so heavy? Is it the cognac
fancy I’ve done nothing unsuitable so far. But anyway
ask her now. They say they make one say one’s prayers. I only hope they
won’t make me! That’ll be too imbecile. And what stuff it is she’s
reading! but she has a good accent. Landau—Bezzubov—what’s he Bezzubov
for?” All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw
was uncontrollably forming a yawn. He pulled his whiskers to cover the
yawn
he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring. He recovered
himself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia Ivanovna
was saying “he’s asleep.” Stepan Arkadyevitch started with dismay
feeling guilty and caught. But he was reassured at once by seeing that
the words “he’s asleep” referred not to him
Frenchman was asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevitch. But Stepan
Arkadyevitch’s being asleep would have offended them
(though even this
queer)
especially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.

_“Mon ami

getting worse and worse.

“_Que la personne qui est arrivée la dernière

opening his eyes.

“_Vous m’excuserez

“_Qu’elle sorte!_” repeated the Frenchman impatiently.

cab-driver

At the French theater where he arrived for the last act
at the Tatar restaurant after his champagne
little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to. But still he felt
quite unlike himself all that evening.

On getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky’s
Arkadyevitch found a note from Betsy. She wrote to him that she was
very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation
to come next day. He had scarcely read this note
contents
carrying something heavy.

Stepan Arkadyevitch went out to look. It was the rejuvenated Pyotr
Oblonsky. He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; but he told
them to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevitch
clinging to him
him how he had spent the evening

Stepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits

recall to his mind
all
had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s.

Next day he received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer
refusing to grant Anna’s divorce
was based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended
trance.


Chapter 23

In order to carry through any undertaking in family life
necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife
or loving agreement. When the relations of a couple are vacillating and
neither one thing nor the other
undertaken.

Many families remain for years in the same place
and wife are sick of it
division nor agreement between them.

Both Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and
dust
all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf
the leaves were covered with dust. But they did not go back to
Vozdvizhenskoe
staying in Moscow
had been no agreement between them.

The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause
efforts to come to an understanding intensified it
it. It was an inner irritation
that his love had grown less; in his
for her sake in a difficult position
made still more difficult. Neither of them gave full utterance to their
sense of grievance
tried on every pretext to prove this to one another.

In her eyes the whole of him
all his spiritual and physical temperament
women
her alone. That love was less; consequently
have transferred part of his love to other women or to another
woman—and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular woman
but of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her
jealousy
transferred her jealousy from one object to another. At one time she
was jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his
old bachelor ties; then she was jealous of the society women he might
meet; then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to
marry
jealousy tortured her most of all
her
she had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young
Princess Sorokina.

And being jealous of him
grounds for indignation in everything. For everything that was
difficult in her position she blamed him. The agonizing condition of
suspense she had passed in Moscow
Alexey Alexandrovitch
had loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position
and would have rescued her from it. For her being in Moscow and not in
the country
country as she would have liked to do. He must have society
put her in this awful position
see. And again
her son.

Even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not
soothe her; in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency
self-confidence

It was dusk. Anna was alone
bachelor dinner. She walked up and down in his study (the room where
the noise from the street was least heard)
detail of their yesterday’s quarrel. Going back from the
well-remembered
ground of it
could hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a
conversation so inoffensive
actually had been. It all arose from his laughing at the girls’ high
schools
spoken slightingly of women’s education in general
Hannah
anything of physics.

This irritated Anna. She saw in this a contemptuous reference to her
occupations. And she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the
pain he had given her. “I don’t expect you to understand me
feelings

And he had actually flushed with vexation
unpleasant. She could not recall her answer
unmistakable desire to wound her too

“I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl
because I see it’s unnatural.”

The cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for
herself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life
injustice with which he had accused her of affectation
artificiality

“I am very sorry that nothing but what’s coarse and material is
comprehensible and natural to you
room.

When he had come in to her yesterday evening
the quarrel
was not at an end.

Today he had not been at home all day
wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it
all
the blame on herself and to justify him.

“I am myself to blame. I’m irritable
it up with him
at peace.”

“Unnatural!” She suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of
all
it was said. “I know what he meant; he meant—unnatural
own daughter
for children
But that wish to wound me! No

And perceiving that
gone round the same circle that she had been round so often before
had come back to her former state of exasperation
herself. “Can it be impossible? Can it be beyond me to control myself?”
she said to herself
truthful
divorce will come. What more do I want? I want peace of mind and trust
and I will take the blame on myself. Yes
tell him I was wrong
tomorrow.”

And to escape thinking any more
she rang
things for the country.

At ten o’clock Vronsky came in.


Chapter 24

“Well

“What do I see? Come

“Yes
to be in the country. There’s nothing to keep you

“It’s the one thing I desire. I’ll be back directly
over; I only want to change my coat. Order some tea.”

And he went into his room.

There was something mortifying in the way he had said “Come
good
still more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his
self-confident tone; and for one instant she felt the lust of strife
rising up in her again
Vronsky as good-humoredly as before.

When he came in she told him
beforehand

“You know it came to me almost like an inspiration
wait here for the divorce? Won’t it be just the same in the country? I
can’t wait any longer! I don’t want to go on hoping
hear anything about the divorce. I have made up my mind it shall not
have any more influence on my life. Do you agree?”

“Oh

“What did you do? Who was there?” she said

Vronsky mentioned the names of the guests. “The dinner was first rate
and the boat race
can never do anything without something _ridicule_. A lady of a sort
appeared on the scene
gave us an exhibition of her skill.”

“How? did she swim?” asked Anna

“In an absurd red _costume de natation;_ she was old and hideous too.
So when shall we go?”

“What an absurd fancy! Why
said Anna

“There was absolutely nothing in it. That’s just what I say
awfully stupid. Well

Anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant
idea.

“When? Why
day after tomorrow.”

“Yes ... oh
to be at maman’s

His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion. She flushed hotly and drew
away from him. It was now not the Queen of Sweden’s swimming-mistress
who filled Anna’s imagination
staying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.

“Can’t you go tomorrow?” she said.

“Well
I can’t get by tomorrow

“If so

“But why so?”

“I shall not go later. Monday or never!”

“What for?” said Vronsky
meaning in it!”

“There’s no meaning in it to you
don’t care to understand my life. The one thing that I cared for here
was Hannah. You say it’s affectation. Why
don’t love my daughter
unnatural. I should like to know what life there is for me that could
be natural!”

For an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing
horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution. But even
though she knew it was her own ruin
could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong
give way to him.

“I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden
passion.”

“How is it
tell the truth?”

“I never boast
rising anger. “It’s a great pity if you can’t respect....”

“Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.
And if you don’t love me any more

“No

“What do you try my patience for?” looking as though he might have said
much more

“What do you mean by that?” she cried
undisguised hatred in his whole face
menacing eyes.

“I mean to say....” he was beginning
ask what it is you want of me?”

“What can I want? All I can want is that you should not desert me
you think of doing
“But that I don’t want; that’s secondary. I want love
none. So then all is over.”

She turned towards the door.

“But how?” she asked herself

Thoughts of where she would go now

now alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel

Petersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would

Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch

time came back to her. And all at once she knew what was in her soul.

With the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in
the armchair
vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death.

Approaching footsteps—his steps—distracted her attention. As though
absorbed in the arrangement of her rings

She did not speak.

“What is it?” he urged.

“You know

Chapter 25

Feeling that the reconciliation was complete
in the morning preparing for their departure. Though it was not settled
whether they should go on Monday or Tuesday
to the other
whether they went a day earlier or later. She was standing in her room
over an open box
earlier than usual

“I’m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the money by
Yegorov. And I shall be ready to go tomorrow

Though she was in such a good mood

“No

It’s only to turn out those things that aren’t wanted
putting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka’s
arms.

Vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining-room.

“You wouldn’t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me
she said
awful than these _chambres garnies_. There’s no individuality in them
no soul. These clocks
wallpapers—they’re a nightmare. I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the
promised land. You’re not sending the horses off yet?”

“No

“I wanted to go to Wilson’s to take some dresses to her. So it’s really
to be tomorrow?” she said in a cheerful voice; but suddenly her face
changed.

Vronsky’s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram
from Petersburg. There was nothing out of the way in Vronsky’s getting
a telegram
her

“By tomorrow

“From whom is the telegram?” she asked

“From Stiva

“Why didn’t you show it to me? What secret can there be between Stiva
and me?”

Vronsky called the valet back

“I didn’t want to show it to you
telegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?”

“About the divorce?”

“Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet. He has
promised a decisive answer in a day or two. But here it is; read it.”

With trembling hands Anna took the telegram
told her. At the end was added: “Little hope; but I will do everything
possible and impossible.”

“I said yesterday that it’s absolutely nothing to me when I get
whether I never get
not the slightest necessity to hide it from me.” “So he may hide and
does hide his correspondence with women from me

“Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov

“No

about it as I do.”

“I care about it because I like definiteness

“Definiteness is not in the form but the love

he spoke. “What do you want it for?”

“My God! love again

“There won’t be children in the future.”

“That’s a great pity

“You want it for the children’s sake

The question of the possibility of having children had long been a
subject of dispute and irritation to her. His desire to have children
she interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty.

“Oh

of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position.”

“Yes

instantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to
him: “It’s not forgotten. It’s all the same.”

“Were you really in love?” she said to Yashvin.

“Oh heavens! ever so many times! But you see
only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a

“What do you want?” she asked in French.

looking-glass of her face
to stop and to say some comforting word to her

that day he spent away from home

begged him not to go in to her.


Chapter 26

Never before had a day been passed in quarrel. Today was the first
time. And this was not a quarrel. It was the open acknowledgment of
complete coldness. Was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced
when he came into the room for the guarantee?—to look at her
heart was breaking with despair
face of callous composure? He was not merely cold to her
because he loved another woman—that was clear.

And remembering all the cruel words he had said
the words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to
her

“I won’t prevent you
were unwilling to be divorced from your husband
might go back to him. Go back to him. If you want money
to you. How many roubles do you want?”

All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say
her imagination
had actually said them.

“But didn’t he only yesterday swear he loved me
sincere man? Haven’t I despaired for nothing many times already?” she
said to herself afterwards.

All that day
hours
there were still hope of reconciliation
once or see him once more. She was expecting him the whole day
the evening
that her head ached
the maid says
all is over

In the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the
entrance
believed what was told him
his own room. So then everything was over.

And death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of
bringing back love for her in his heart
gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession
of her heart was waging with him.

Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe
not getting a divorce from her husband—all that did not matter. The one
thing that mattered was punishing him. When she poured herself out her
usual dose of opium
whole bottle to die
began musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer
her memory when it would be too late. She lay in bed with open eyes
the light of a single burned-down candle
of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it
while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would
be no more
such cruel things to her?” he would say. “How could I go out of the
room without saying anything to her? But now she is no more. She has
gone away from us forever. She is....” Suddenly the shadow of the
screen wavered

not realize where she was
could not find the matches and light another candle
that had burned down and gone out. “No

said
down her cheeks. And to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his
room.

He was asleep there
holding the light above his face
when he was asleep
not keep back tears of tenderness. But she knew that if he waked up he
would look at her with cold eyes
before telling him of her love
had been wrong in his treatment of her. Without waking him

consciousness.

In the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare
recurred several times in her dreams
Vronsky. A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent
down over some iron
she always did in this nightmare (it was what made the horror of it)
felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her
something horrible with the iron—over her. And she waked up in a cold
sweat.

When she got up

“There was a quarrel. Just what has happened several times. I said I
had a headache

window. She saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up
to the carriage. The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel.

ran rapidly upstairs again.

The mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly. The
feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang. She
could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending
a whole day with him in his house. She went into his room to announce
her determination.

“That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter. They came and brought me
the money and the deeds from maman. I couldn’t get them yesterday. How

to get her signature to the deeds.

She heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining-room.
At the drawing-room he stood still. But he did not turn in to see her
he merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he
came while he was away. Then she heard the carriage brought round

again
for his gloves that had been forgotten. She went to the window and saw
him take the gloves without looking

settled himself in his usual attitude in the carriage

“Very good. Wait a minute. I’ll write a note at once. Send Mihail with
the note to the stables. Make haste.”

She sat down and wrote:

“I was wrong. Come back home; I must explain. For God’s sake come! I’m
afraid.”

She sealed it up and gave it to the servant.

She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant out of
the room

“Why

It was bright and sunny. A fine rain had been falling all the morning
and now it had not long cleared up. The iron roofs
roads
and the tinplate of the carriages—all glistened brightly in the May
sunshine. It was three o’clock

As she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage
on its supple springs
the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure
air
position quite differently from how it had seemed at home. Now the
thought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her
death itself no longer seemed so inevitable. Now she blamed herself for
the humiliation to which she had lowered herself. “I entreat him to
forgive me. I have given in to him. I have owned myself in fault. What
for? Can’t I live without him?” And leaving unanswered the question how
she was going to live without him

They say they send their dough to Petersburg. The Moscow water is so

And she remembered how

that really me
splendid and out of reach has become worthless

I could come to such humiliation? How conceited and self-satisfied he
will be when he gets my note! But I will show him.... How horrid that
paint smells! Why is it they’re always painting and building? _Modes et
robes
parasites”; she remembered how Vronsky had said that. “Our? Why our?
What’s so awful is that one can’t tear up the past by its roots. One
can’t tear it out
it.” And then she thought of her past with Alexey Alexandrovitch
how she had blotted the memory of it out of her life. “Dolly will think
I’m leaving my second husband
As if I cared to be right! I can’t help it!” she said
to cry. But at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be
smiling about. “Love
how low.... The boulevard and the children. Three boys running
at horses. Seryozha! And I’m losing everything and not getting him
back. Yes
late for the train and has come back by now. Longing for humiliation
again!” she said to herself. “No

Thinking over the words in which she would tell Dolly
working her heart up to great bitterness

“Is there anyone with her?” she asked in the hall.

“Katerina Alexandrovna Levin

The sisters were having a consultation about nursing when Anna called.
Dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their
conversation.

“Well
said; “I had a letter from Stiva today.”

“We had a telegram too

“He writes that he can’t make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch
wants

“I thought you had someone with you. Can I see the letter?”

“Yes; Kitty
has been very ill.”

“So I heard. May I see the letter?”

“I’ll get it directly. But he doesn’t refuse; on the contrary
has hopes

“I haven’t

“What’s this? Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?” thought
Anna when she was alone. “Perhaps she’s right

sacrificed everything to him. And this is my reward! Oh

am I going to say to Dolly now? Amuse Kitty by the sight of my
wretchedness

only be interesting to see Kitty

Dolly came in with the letter. Anna read it and handed it back in
silence.

“I knew all that

“Oh
inquisitively at Anna. She had never seen her in such a strangely
irritable condition. “When are you going away?” she asked.

“Why does Kitty shrink from me?” she said
flushing red.

“Oh

Hearing that Anna had called

“I am so glad to see you

Kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her
antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her. But as
soon as she saw Anna’s lovely and attractive face
antagonism disappeared.

“I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. I’m
used to everything. You have been ill? Yes
Anna.

Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes. She ascribed
this hostility to the awkward position in which Anna
patronized her

They talked of Kitty’s illness
obvious that nothing interested Anna.

“I came to say good-bye to you

Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than
when she set out from home. To her previous tortures was added now that
sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so
distinctly on meeting Kitty.

“Where to? Home?” asked Pyotr.

“Yes

“How they looked at me as something dreadful
curious! What can he be telling the other with such warmth?” she
thought
what one is feeling? I meant to tell Dolly
didn’t tell her. How pleased she would have been at my misery! She
would have concealed it
at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for. Kitty
would have been even more pleased. How I can see through her! She knows
I was more than usually sweet to her husband. And she’s jealous and
hates me. And she despises me. In her eyes I’m an immoral woman. If I
were an immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with
me ... if I’d cared to. And

this humbug? Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these
cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily. Yashvin says

She was plunged in these thoughts
off thinking of her own position

meet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.

“Is there an answer?” she inquired.

“I’ll see this minute

“I can’t come before ten o’clock.—Vronsky

“And hasn’t the messenger come back?”

“No

“Then
vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her
upstairs. “I’ll go to him myself. Before going away forever
him all. Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!” she thought.
Seeing his hat on the rack
consider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he
had not yet received her note. She pictured him to herself as talking
calmly to his mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her
sufferings. “Yes
she was going. She longed to get away as quickly as possible from the
feelings she had gone through in that awful house. The servants
walls
and lay like a weight upon her.

“Yes
there and catch him.” Anna looked at the railway timetable in the
newspapers. An evening train went at two minutes past eight. “Yes
shall be in time.” She gave orders for the other horses to be put in
the carriage
days. She knew she would never come back here again.

Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that
after what would happen at the station or at the countess’s house
would go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.

Dinner was on the table; she went up
cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting. She
ordered the carriage and went out. The house threw a shadow now right
across the street

the things in the carriage

“Here it is again! Again I understand it all!” Anna said to herself
soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly

recall it. “‘_Tiutkin

And now for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she
was seeing everything on to her relations with him
hitherto avoided thinking about. “What was it he sought in me? Not love
so much as the satisfaction of vanity.” She remembered his words
expression of his face
early days of their connection. And everything now confirmed this.
“Yes

Anna made no answer. The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did
not notice under her veil her panic-stricken face. She went back to her
corner and sat down. The couple seated themselves on the opposite side
and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes. Both husband
and wife seemed repulsive to Anna. The husband asked
him to smoke

monstrosities.

A second bell sounded

When the train came into the station
passengers
stood on the platform
what she meant to do. Everything that had seemed to her possible before
was now so difficult to consider
hideous people who would not leave her alone. One moment porters ran up
to her proffering their services
on the planks of the platform and talking loudly
meeting her dodged past on the wrong side. Remembering that she had
meant to go on further if there were no answer
and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.

“Count Vronsky? They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute
to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter. And what is the coachman
like?”

Just as she was talking to the porter

said of the lace she was wearing. The young men would not leave her in
peace. Again they passed by
shouting something in an unnatural voice. The station-master coming up
asked her whether she was going by train. A boy selling kvas never took
his eyes off her. “My God! where am I to go?” she thought
farther and farther along the platform. At the end she stopped. Some
ladies and children
paused in their loud laughter and talking
reached them. She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the
edge of the platform. A luggage train was coming in. The platform began
to sway

And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she
had first met Vronsky
light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails
and stopped quite near the approaching train.

She looked at the lower part of the carriages
and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up
and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels
the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.

“There
at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers—“there
very middle
myself.”

She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it
reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand
delayed her
wait for the next carriage. A feeling such as she had known when about
to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her
herself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole
series of girlish and childish memories
had covered everything for her was torn apart
her for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not take
her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. And exactly at the
moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her
the red bag
hands under the carriage
at once
terror-stricken at what she was doing. “Where am I? What am I doing?
What for?” She tried to get up
and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back. “Lord
forgive me all!” she said
muttering something was working at the iron above her. And the light by
which she had read the book filled with troubles
and evil
all that had been in darkness
quenched forever.






PART EIGHT


Chapter 1

Almost two months had passed. The hot summer was half over
Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.

Sergey Ivanovitch’s life had not been uneventful during this time. A
year ago he had finished his book
“Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe
and Russia.” Several sections of this book and its introduction had
appeared in periodical publications
Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle
of the work could not be completely novel to the public. But still
Sergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be
sure to make a serious impression on society
revolution in social science it would
in the scientific world.

After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been
published

Though he asked no one about it
indifference answered his friends’ inquiries as to how the book was
going
selling
attention
world and in literature.

But a week passed
whatever could be detected. His friends who were specialists and
savants
rest of his acquaintances
subject
especially absorbed in other things—was absolutely indifferent. In the
press

Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for
writing a review
silence.

Only in the _Northern Beetle_
Drabanti
Koznishev’s book
through by everyone

At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious
review. Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article. He had met
him once at Golubtsov’s.

The author of the article was a young man
writer
relations.

In spite of his absolute contempt for the author
respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article. The
article was awful.

The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which
could not possibly be put on it. But he had selected quotations so
adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously
scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole
book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases
suggested by marks of interrogation—used appropriately
author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the
subject. And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would
not have disowned such wit himself. But that was just what was so
awful.

In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey
Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic’s arguments
not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were
ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall
every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the
article.

“Didn’t I offend him in some way?” Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.

And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about
something he had said that betrayed ignorance
the clue to explain the article.

This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in
the press and in conversation
years’ task
trace.

Sergey Ivanovitch’s position was still more difficult from the fact
that
to do

Sergey Ivanovitch was clever
he did not know what use to make of his energy. Conversations in
drawing-rooms
talk was possible—took up part of his time. But being used for years to
town life
experienced younger brother did
deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.

Fortunately for him
failure of his book

and of spiritualism
Slavonic question
society
this subject

In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged
of or written about just now but the Servian War. Everything that the
idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of
the Slavonic States. Balls
dresses
Slavonic peoples.

From much of what was spoken and written on the subject
Ivanovitch differed on various points. He saw that the Slavonic
question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed
one another in providing society with an object and an occupation. He
saw
motives of self-interest and self-advertisement. He recognized that the
newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated
with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.
He saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most
forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were
smarting under a sense of injury—generals without armies
in the ministry
followers. He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous
and absurd. But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing
enthusiasm
sympathize. The massacre of men who were fellow Christians
same Slavonic race
against the oppressors. And the heroism of the Servians and
Montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a
longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed.

But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.
That was the manifestation of public opinion. The public had definitely
expressed its desire. The soul of the people had
said
incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume
vast dimensions

He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause
and forgot to think about his book. His whole time now was engrossed by
it
appeals addressed to him. He worked the whole spring and part of the
summer
brother’s in the country.

He was going both to rest for a fortnight
people
that uplifting of the spirit of the people
residents in the capital and big towns
Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with

Chapter 2

Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of
the Kursk line
day
things
met them with bouquets of flowers
they went into the station.

One of the ladies
addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.

“You too come to see them off?” she asked in French.

“No
you always see them off?” said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly
perceptible smile.

“Oh
eight hundred have been sent from us already? Malvinsky wouldn’t
believe me.”

“More than eight hundred. If you reckon those who have been sent not
directly from Moscow

“There! That’s just what I said!” exclaimed the lady. “And it’s true
too

“Yes

“What do you say to today’s telegram? Beaten the Turks again.”

“Yes
last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in
succession beaten at all points and put to flight
decisive engagement was expected.

“Ah
they’ve made some difficulty
know him; please write a note about his case. He’s being sent by
Countess Lidia Ivanovna.”

Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the
young man
the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended
handed it to the princess.

“You know Count Vronsky
said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning
found her again and gave her the letter.

“I had heard he was going

“I’ve seen him. He’s here: there’s only his mother seeing him off. It’s
the best thing

“Oh

While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the
dining-room. They went forward too
in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers. “In the
service of religion
his voice growing louder and louder; “to this great cause mother Moscow
dedicates you with her blessing. _Jivio!_ he concluded
tearfully.

Everyone shouted _Jivio!_ and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall
almost carrying the princess off her legs.

“Ah
suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them
with a delighted smile. “Capitally
Sergey Ivanovitch! Why

forward a little by the arm.

“No

“Where to?”

“To the country

“Then you’ll see my wife. I’ve written to her
first. Please tell her that they’ve seen me and that it’s ‘all right
as the English say. She’ll understand. Oh
her I’m appointed secretary of the committee.... But she’ll understand!
You know
apologizing to the princess. “And Princess Myakaya—not Liza
Bibish—is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses. Did I tell you?”

“Yes

“It’s a pity you’re going away
we’re giving a dinner to two who’re setting off—Dimer-Bartnyansky from
Petersburg and our Veslovsky
only lately married. There’s a fine fellow for you! Eh
turned to the lady.

The princess looked at Koznishev without replying. But the fact that
Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did
not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch. Smiling
the feather in the princess’s hat
going to pick something up. Seeing a lady approaching with a collecting
box

“I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I’ve money in my
pocket
Montenegrins!”

“You don’t say so!” he cried
was going by this train. For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch’s face
looked sad
swinging as he walked
completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister’s corpse
and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.

“With all his faults one can’t refuse to do him justice
princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left
them. “What a typically Russian
be pleasant for Vronsky to see him. Say what you will
that man’s fate. Do talk to him a little on the way
princess.

“Yes

“I never liked him. But this atones for a great deal. He’s not merely
going himself

“Yes

A bell sounded. Everyone crowded to the doors. “Here he is!” said the
princess
wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat. Oblonsky was
walking beside him

Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him
not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.

Probably on Oblonsky’s pointing them out
direction where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing
without speaking lifted his hat. His face
looked stony.

Going onto the platform
compartment.

On the platform there rang out “God save the Tsar
“hurrah!” and _“jivio!”_ One of the volunteers
with a hollow chest
his felt hat and a nosegay over his head. Then two officers emerged
bowing too
cap.


Chapter 3

Saying good-bye to the princess
Katavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing
the train started.

At Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men
singing “Hail to Thee!” Again the volunteers bowed and poked their
heads out
so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and
did not interest him. Katavasov
his having a chance of observing them hitherto
interested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.

Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to go into the second-class and talk to
them himself. At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.

At the first stop he moved into the second-class and made the
acquaintance of the volunteers. They were sitting in a corner of the
carriage
passengers and Katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them. More
loudly than all talked the tall
unmistakably tipsy
his school. Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian
military jacket of the Guards uniform. He was listening with a smile to
the hollow-chested youth
in an artillery uniform
asleep.

Entering into conversation with the youth
was a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune
before he was two-and-twenty. Katavasov did not like him
was unmanly and effeminate and sickly. He was obviously convinced
especially now after drinking
and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way.

The second
Katavasov. He was
been on a railway
and he talked
learned expressions quite inappropriately.

The third
favorably. He was a quiet
knowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant
and saying nothing about himself. When Katavasov asked him what had
impelled him to go to Servia

“Oh
them.”

“Yes

“Oh
infantry or the cavalry.”

“Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?” said
Katavasov
have reached a fairly high grade.

“I wasn’t long in the artillery; I’m a cadet retired
began to explain how he had failed in his examination.

All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov
when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink
have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with
someone. There was an old man in the carriage
overcoat
conversation with the volunteers. When they were left alone
addressed him.

“What different positions they come from
going off there
own opinion
views.

The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns. He knew
what makes a soldier
those persons
bottle on the journey
lived in a district town
had volunteered from his town
employ as a laborer. But knowing by experience that in the present
condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion
opposed to the general one
unfavorably

“Well
fell to talking of the last war news
his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day
had been beaten
they parted

Katavasov went back to his own carriage
reported to Sergey Ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers
which it would appear that they were capital fellows.

At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with
shouts and singing
and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed
them into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and
feebler scale than in Moscow.


Chapter 4

While the train was stopping at the provincial town
did not go to the refreshment room
platform.

The first time he passed Vronsky’s compartment he noticed that the
curtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the second time
he saw the old countess at the window. She beckoned to Koznishev.

“I’m going

“Yes
peeping in. “What a noble act on his part!” he added
Vronsky was not in the compartment.

“Yes

“What a terrible thing it was!” said Sergey Ivanovitch.

“Ah
through!” she repeated
beside her. “You can’t conceive it! For six weeks he did not speak to
anyone
for one minute could we leave him alone. We took away everything he
could have used against himself. We lived on the ground floor
there was no reckoning on anything. You know
shot himself once already on her account
eyelashes twitched at the recollection. “Yes
for such a woman. Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.”

“It’s not for us to judge
can understand that it has been very hard for you.”

“Ah
A note was brought him. He wrote an answer and sent it off. We hadn’t
an idea that she was close by at the station. In the evening I had only
just gone to my room
under the train. Something seemed to strike me at once. I knew it was
she. The first thing I said was
him already. His coachman was there and saw it all. When I ran into his
room
word
there
him. _Prostration complète
almost by madness. Oh
of her hand. “It was an awful time! No
bad woman. Why
all to show herself something out of the way. Well
do. She brought herself to ruin and two good men—her husband and my
unhappy son.”

“And what did her husband do?” asked Sergey Ivanovitch.

“He has taken her daughter. Alexey was ready to agree to anything at
first. Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own
child away to another man. But he can’t take back his word. Karenin
came to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey. For
him
my poor son was utterly given up to her. He had thrown up everything
his career
purpose she made his ruin complete. No
death was the death of a vile woman
forgive me
my son’s misery!”

“But how is he now?”

“It was a blessing from Providence for us—this Servian war. I’m old
and I don’t understand the rights and wrongs of it
providential blessing to him. Of course for me
terrible; and what’s worse
Pétersbourg_. But it can’t be helped! It was the one thing that could
rouse him. Yashvin—a friend of his—he had lost all he had at cards and
he was going to Servia. He came to see him and persuaded him to go. Now
it’s an interest for him. Do please talk to him a little. I want to
distract his mind. He’s so low-spirited. And as bad luck would have it
he has toothache too. But he’ll be delighted to see you. Please do talk
to him; he’s walking up and down on that side.”

Sergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to
the other side of the station.


Chapter 5

In the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the
platform
in his pockets
turning sharply after twenty paces. Sergey Ivanovitch fancied
approached him
This did not affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest. He was above
all personal considerations with Vronsky.

At that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an
important part in a great cause
encourage him and express his approval. He went up to him.

Vronsky stood still
a few steps forward to meet him

“Possibly you didn’t wish to see me
couldn’t I be of use to you?”

“There’s no one I should less dislike seeing than you
“Excuse me; and there’s nothing in life for me to like.”

“I quite understand
Sergey Ivanovitch
suffering. “Wouldn’t it be of use to you to have a letter to
Ristitch—to Milan?”

“Oh
you don’t mind
letter? No
introduction. Nor for the Turks....” he said
merely of the lips. His eyes still kept their look of angry suffering.

“Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations
after all essential
like. I was very glad to hear of your intention. There have been so
many attacks made on the volunteers
public estimation.”

“My use as a man
And that I’ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks
to trample on them or fall—I know that. I’m glad there’s something to
give my life for
Anyone’s welcome to it.” And his jaw twitched impatiently from the
incessant gnawing toothache
a natural expression.

“You will become another man
feeling touched. “To deliver one’s brother-men from bondage is an aim
worth death and life. God grant you success outwardly—and inwardly
peace
outstretched hand.

“Yes
jerked out.

He could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth
were like rows of ivory in his mouth. He was silent
rested on the wheels of the tender
the rails.

And all at once a different pain
that set his whole being in anguish
toothache. As he glanced at the tender and the rails
influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his
misfortune
when he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway
station—on the table
bloodstained body so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back
with its weight of hair
the exquisite face
expression
seemed to utter that fearful phrase—that he would be sorry for it—that
she had said when they were quarreling.

And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time
at a railway station too
giving happiness
that last moment. He tried to recall his best moments with her
those moments were poisoned forever. He could only think of her as
triumphant
to be effaced. He lost all consciousness of toothache
worked with sobs.

Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining
his self-possession

“You have had no telegrams since yesterday’s? Yes
third time

And after talking a little more of King Milan’s proclamation
immense effect it might have
hearing the second bell.

Sergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet
him
was not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at
the station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house
Moors from the dust of the road. Kitty

“What a shame not to have let us know
Sergey Ivanovitch

“We drove here capitally
Ivanovitch. “I’m so dirty. I’m afraid to touch you. I’ve been so busy
I didn’t know when I should be able to tear myself away. And so you’re
still as ever enjoying your peaceful
smiling
Here’s our friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting
here at last.”

“But I’m not a negro
said Katavasov in his jesting fashion
his teeth flashing white in his black face.

“Kostya will be delighted. He has gone to his settlement. It’s time he
should be home.”

“Busy as ever with his farming. It really is a peaceful backwater
said Katavasov; “while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.
Well
people.”

“Oh

And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash

orders for their luncheon

This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so
close
and knew for certain he was hungry.

She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery. And he was
indeed crying. She heard him and hastened. But the faster she went
louder he screamed. It was a fine healthy scream

“Has he been screaming long
seating herself on a chair
“But give me him quickly. Oh

The baby’s greedy scream was passing into sobs.

“But you can’t manage so
always to be found in the nursery. “He must be put straight. A-oo!
a-oo!” she chanted over him

The nurse brought the baby to his mother. Agafea Mihalovna followed him
with a face dissolving with tenderness.

“He knows me
ma’am

But Kitty did not hear her words. Her impatience kept growing
baby’s.

Their impatience hindered things for a while. The baby could not get
hold of the breast right

At last
things went right
and both subsided into calm.

“But poor darling

“What makes you think he knows you?” she added

She smiled because
she was sure that he knew not merely Agafea Mihalovna

“When he wakes up

Chapter 7

Agafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind

branch of birch over the mother and the baby.

“How hot it is! if God would send a drop of rain

That hand worried Kitty; she longed to kiss the little hand
afraid to for fear of waking the baby. At last the little hand ceased

“They have got into talk without me

again. Though it’s a pity he’s there so often
distracts his mind. He’s become altogether happier and better now than
in the spring. He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt
frightened for him. And how absurd he is!” she whispered

She knew what worried her husband. It was his unbelief. Although
she had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life

“What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?”
she wondered. “If it’s all written in those books

his thinking so much? And he thinks so much from being solitary. He’s
always alone
glad of these visitors

it would be more convenient to put Katavasov
share Sergey Ivanovitch’s room. And then an idea suddenly struck her
which made her shudder and even disturb Mitya
her. “I do believe the laundress hasn’t sent the washing yet
the best sheets are in use. If I don’t see to it

“Well

And a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind. A
fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to
Dolly. He besought her to save his honor
debts. Dolly was in despair

agreeing to sell part of her property. After that

Dolly without wounding her pride
not occurred to her before—that she should give up her share of the
property.

“He an unbeliever indeed! With his heart

Sergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya’s duty to be his
steward. And it’s the same with his sister. Now Dolly and her children
are under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every

Ever since

These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for
intellectual purposes. But for life they yielded nothing
felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a
muslin garment
immediately convinced
is as good as naked

From that moment
on living as before
lack of knowledge.

He vaguely felt
merely lack of knowledge
ideas

At first
completely crowded out these thoughts. But of late
staying in Moscow after his wife’s confinement
question that clamored for solution had more and more often
more insistently

The question was summed up for him thus: “If I do not accept the
answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life
I accept?” And in the whole arsenal of his convictions
finding any satisfactory answers
anything at all like an answer.

He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool
shops.

Instinctively
with every man he met
questions and their solution.

What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority
of men of his age and circle had
for the same new convictions
and were perfectly satisfied and serene. So that
principal question
these people sincere? he asked himself
was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems
in some different
studied both these men’s opinions and the books which treated of these
scientific explanations.

One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind
was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of
the circle of his young days at college
day
nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers. The old
prince
the women believed
in his earliest childhood
people
respect

Another fact of which he became convinced
scientific books
construction to put on them
questions which he felt he could not live without answering
ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no
possible interest to him
materialistic theory of consciousness

Moreover
seemed extraordinary to him. He
praying
passed
the rest of his life.

He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth
he was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it
fell to pieces. He could not admit that he was mistaken then
spiritual condition then was precious to him
a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments. He was
miserably divided against himself
forces to the utmost to escape from this condition.

Chapter 9

These doubts fretted and harassed him
time to time
he read and the more he thought
was pursuing.

Of late in Moscow and in the country
that he would find no solution in the materialists
re-read thoroughly Plato
Schopenhauer
of life.

Their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself
seeking arguments to refute other theories
materialists; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a
solution of problems
followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as _spirit
freedom
the philosophers set for him
had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning
life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with
the fixed definitions
at once like a house of cards
been built up out of those transposed words
life more important than reason.

At one time
word _love_
till he removed a little away from it. But then
life itself to glance at it again
the same muslin garment with no warmth in it.

His brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works
of Homiakov. Levin read the second volume of Homiakov’s works
spite of the elegant
repelled him
in them. He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of
divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man
men bound together by love—to the church. What delighted him was the
thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living
church
and therefore holy and infallible
God
a mysterious
reading a Catholic writer’s history of the church
orthodox writer’s history of the church
churches
of the other
him
edifices.

All that spring he was not himself
horror.

“Without knowing what I am and why I am here
that I can’t know

“In infinite time
bubble-organism
bubble is Me.”

It was an agonizing error
of human thought in that direction.

This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by
human thought in almost all their ramifications rested. It was the
prevalent conviction
unconsciously
clearest

But it was not merely a falsehood
power

He must escape from this power. And the means of escape every man had
in his own hands. He had but to cut short this dependence on evil. And
there was one means—death.

And Levin
times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted
to hang himself
shooting himself.

But Levin did not shoot himself
living.


Chapter 10

When Levin thought what he was and what he was living for
find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair
off questioning himself about it. It seemed as though he knew both what
he was and for what he was living
and without hesitation. Indeed
decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been.

When he went back to the country at the beginning of June
also to his usual pursuits. The management of the estate
with the peasants and the neighbors
management of his sister’s and brother’s property
direction
child
filled all his time.

These things occupied him now
by any sort of general principles
the contrary
general welfare
mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides
completely given up thinking of the general good
with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what
he was doing—that he could not do otherwise. In former days—almost from
childhood
anything that would be good for all
whole village
but the work itself had always been incoherent
had a full conviction of its absolute necessity
had begun by seeming so great
vanished into nothing. But now
to confine himself more and more to living for himself
experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing
he felt a complete conviction of its necessity
far better than in old days

Now
like a plough
the furrow.

To live the same family life as his father and forefathers—that is
the same condition of culture—and to bring up his children in the same
was incontestably necessary. It was as necessary as dining when one was
hungry. And to do this
necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so
as to yield an income. Just as incontestably as it was necessary to
repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition
that his son
to his father as Levin had said “thank you” to his grandfather for all
he built and planted. And to do this it was necessary to look after the
land himself
and plant timber.

It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch
of his sister
accustomed to do so—as impossible as to fling down a child one is
carrying in one’s arms. It was necessary to look after the comfort of
his sister-in-law and her children
was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.

And all this
the whole of Levin’s life
began to think.

But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do
the same way _how_ he had to do it all
than the rest.

He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men
under bond
wages
Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was
what he might do
and the pothouse must be put down
Felling timber must be punished as severely as possible
not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though
it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their
cattle on his land

To Pyotr
lend a sum of money to set him free. But he could not let off peasants
who did not pay their rent
impossible to overlook the bailiff’s not having mown the meadows and
letting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres
where a young copse had been planted. It was impossible to excuse a
laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was
dying
his pay those costly months of idleness. But it was impossible not to
allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for
anything.

Levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife
who was unwell
hours to see him could wait a little longer. He knew too that
regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm
forego that pleasure
while he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the
bee-house.

Whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know
trying to prove that he was
about it.

Reasoning had brought him to doubt
he ought to do and what he ought not. When he did not think
lived
in his soul
the better and which was the worse
rightly

So he lived
was and what he was living for
to such a point that he was afraid of suicide
down his own individual definite path in life.


Chapter 11

The day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of
Levin’s most painful days. It was the very busiest working time
all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in
labor
would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities
themselves thought highly of them
year

To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it
turn over the fallows
seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all
everyone in the village
incessantly for three or four weeks
living on rye-beer
sheaves at night
twenty-four to sleep. And every year this is done all over Russia.

Having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the
closest relations with the peasants
time that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the
people.

In the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye
to the oats
at the time his wife and sister-in-law were getting up
with them and walked to the farm
be set working to get ready the seed-corn.

He was standing in the cool granary
the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the
new thatch roof. He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter
dust of the thrashing whirled and played
floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from
the barn
chirping in under the roof and
crevices of the doorway
dusty barn

“Why is it all being done?” he thought. “Why am I standing here
them work? What are they all so busy for
before me? What is that old Matrona
doctored her
looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain
painfully with her bare
floor. “Then she recovered
won’t; they’ll bury her
that smart girl in the red jacket
shakes the ears out of their husks. They’ll bury her and this piebald
horse
panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him.
“And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard
full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders—they will bury
him. He’s untying the sheaves
women
what’s more
be left. What for?”

He thought this
much they thrashed in an hour. He wanted to know this so as to judge by
it the task to set for the day.

“It’ll soon be one
thought Levin. He went up to the man that was feeding the machine
shouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more
slowly. “You put in too much at a time
choked

Fyodor
something in response
him to.

Levin
the corn in himself. Working on till the peasants’ dinner hour
was not long in coming
into talk with him
the thrashing floor for seed.

Fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin
had once allotted land to his cooperative association. Now it had been
let to a former house porter.

Levin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon
well-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village
would not take the land for the coming year.

“It’s a high rent; it wouldn’t pay Platon
answered the peasant

“But how does Kirillov make it pay?”

“Mituh!” (so the peasant called the house porter
contempt)
He’ll get his share
on a Christian. But Uncle Fokanitch” (so he called the old peasant
Platon)
debt
He’s a man too.”

“But why will he let anyone off?”

“Oh
wants and nothing else
belly
not forget God.”

“How thinks of God? How does he live for his soul?” Levin almost
shouted.

“Why
now

“Yes
turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home.
At the peasant’s words that Fokanitch lived for his soul
God’s way
though they had been locked up
thronged whirling through his head


Chapter 12

Levin strode along the highroad
(he could not yet disentangle them) as in his spiritual condition
unlike anything he had experienced before.

The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric
shock
whole swarm of disjointed
occupied his mind. These thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind
even when he was talking about the land.

He was aware of something new in his soul
thing

“Not living for his own wants
say anything more senseless than what he said? He said that one must
not live for one’s own wants
we understand
for something incomprehensible
even define. What of it? Didn’t I understand those senseless words of
Fyodor’s? And understanding them
think them stupid
as he understands the words. I understood them more fully and clearly
than I understand anything in life
nor can I doubt about it. And not only I
understands nothing fully but this
doubt and are always agreed.

“And I looked out for miracles
which would convince me. A material miracle would have persuaded me.
And here is a miracle
surrounding me on all sides

“Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly. That’s comprehensible
and rational. All of us as rational beings can’t do anything else but
live for our belly. And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one
mustn’t live for one’s belly
a hint I understand him! And I and millions of men
ago and men living now—peasants
who have thought and written about it
the same thing—we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must
live for and what is good. I and all men have only one firm
incontestable
by the reason—it is outside it
effects.

“If goodness has causes
reward
cause and effect.

“And yet I know it

“What could be a greater miracle than that?

“Can I have found the solution of it all? can my sufferings be over?”
thought Levin
his weariness
suffering. This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him
incredible. He was breathless with emotion and incapable of going
farther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the
shade of an aspen on the uncut grass. He took his hat off his hot head
and lay propped on his elbow in the lush

“Yes
looking intently at the untrampled grass before him
movements of a green beetle
lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed. “What have I
discovered?” he asked himself
of the beetle’s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the
beetle to cross over onto it. “What is it makes me glad? What have I
discovered?

“I have discovered nothing. I have only found out what I knew. I
understand the force that in the past gave me life
me life. I have been set free from falsity

“Of old I used to say that in my body
and of this beetle (there
her wings and flown away)
matter in accordance with physical
And in all of us
patches
what?—Eternal evolution and struggle.... As though there could be any
sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal! And I was astonished that
in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not
discover the meaning of life
Now I say that I know the meaning of my life: ‘To live for God
soul.’ And this meaning
marvelous. Such
pride
to tie a noose of blades of grass

“And not merely pride of intellect
of all

And he briefly went through
during the last two years
confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill.

Then
there was nothing in store but suffering

must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him
as the evil jest of some devil

But he had not done either
feeling
and had been happy
life.

What did this mean? It meant that he had been living rightly
thinking wrongly.

He had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual truths that
he had sucked in with his mother’s milk
without recognition of these truths

Now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the
beliefs in which he had been brought up.

“What should I have been
not had these beliefs
not for my own desires? I should have robbed and lied and killed.
Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed
for me.” And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not
conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself
known what he was living for.

“I looked for an answer to my question. And thought could not give an
answer to my question—it is incommensurable with my question. The
answer has been given me by life itself
right and what is wrong. And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any
way
have got it from anywhere.

“Where could I have got it? By reason could I have arrived at knowing
that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him? I was told that in my
childhood
in my soul. But who discovered it? Not reason. Reason discovered the
struggle for existence
hinder the satisfaction of our desires. That is the deduction of
reason. But loving one’s neighbor reason could never discover
it’s irrational.”

Chapter 13

And Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly and
her children. The children
raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other’s
mouths with a syringe. Their mother
began reminding them in Levin’s presence of the trouble their mischief
gave to the grown-up people
sake
drink their tea out of
have nothing to eat

And Levin had been struck by the passive
the children heard what their mother said to them. They were simply
annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted
believe a word of what their mother was saying. They could not believe
it indeed
habitually enjoyed
destroying was the very thing they lived by.

“That all comes of itself
interesting or important about it because it has always been so
always will be so. And it’s all always the same. We’ve no need to think
about that
and new. So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup
them over a candle
mouths. That’s fun
drinking out of cups.”

“Isn’t it just the same that we do
reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of
the life of man?” he thought.

“And don’t all the theories of philosophy do the same
path of thought
to a knowledge of what he has known long ago
that he could not live at all without it? Isn’t it distinctly to be
seen in the development of each philosopher’s theory
what is the chief significance of life beforehand
as the peasant Fyodor
simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what
everyone knows?

“Now then
make their crockery
be naughty then? Why
our passions and thoughts
Creator
moral evil.

“Just try and build up anything without those ideas!

“We only try to destroy them
Exactly like the children!

“Whence have I that joyful knowledge
alone gives peace to my soul? Whence did I get it?

“Brought up with an idea of God
the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me

and hungry
mother scolds them for their childish mischief
childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.

“Yes
revealed to me
thing taught by the church.

“The church! the church!” Levin repeated to himself. He turned over on
the other side
distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.

“But can I believe in all the church teaches?” he thought
himself
peace of mind. Intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the
church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a
stumbling block to him.

“The Creation? But how did I explain existence? By existence? By
nothing? The devil and sin. But how do I explain evil?... The
atonement?...

“But I know nothing
told to me and all men.”

And it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of
the church which could destroy the chief thing—faith in God
goodness

Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in
the service of truth instead of one’s desires. And each doctrine did
not simply leave that faith unshaken
complete that great miracle
it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men
men and imbeciles
beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing

which alone is precious to us.

Lying on his back

But

Levin ceased thinking
voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him.

“Can this be faith?” he thought
“My God
hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes.


Chapter 14

Levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle
of his trap with Raven in the shafts
to the herd
of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him. But he was
so buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman
had come for him.

He only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him
and shouted to him. “The mistress sent me. Your brother has come
some gentleman with him.”

Levin got into the trap and took the reins. As though just roused out
of sleep
stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and
on his neck
sitting beside him
thought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence
tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother. And
his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite
different from before. He fancied that now his relations with all men
would be different.

“With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used
to be between us
never be quarrels; with the visitor
friendly and nice; with the servants
different.”

Pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with
impatience and seemed begging to be let go
sitting beside him
continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out
find something to start a conversation about with him. He would have
said that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high
like blame
occurred to him.

“Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump
coachman

“Please don’t touch and don’t teach me!” said Levin
interference. Now
sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his
spiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with
reality.

He was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw Grisha and Tanya
running to meet him.

“Uncle Kostya! mamma’s coming
and someone else

“Who is he?”

“An awfully terrible person! And he does like this with his arms
Tanya

“Old or young?” asked Levin
know whom

“Oh

As soon as he turned
Levin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat
arms just as Tanya had shown him. Katavasov was very fond of discussing
metaphysics
who had never studied metaphysics
arguments with him of late.

And one of these arguments
that he came off victorious
recognized him.

“No
lightly

Getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and Katavasov
asked about his wife.

“She has taken Mitya to Kolok” (a copse near the house). “She meant to
have him out there because it’s so hot indoors
always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood
unsafe

“She rushes about from place to place with him
smiling. “I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.”

“She meant to come to the bee-house. She thought you would be there. We
are going there

“Well
from the rest and walking beside him.

“Oh
“Well
for such a long time.”

“Only for a fortnight. I’ve a great deal to do in Moscow.”

At these words the brothers’ eyes met
desire he always had
affectionate and still more open terms with his brother
awkwardness in looking at him. He dropped his eyes and did not know
what to say.

Casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to
Sergey Ivanovitch
war and the Slavonic question
to what he had to do in Moscow
Ivanovitch’s book.

“Well

Sergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.

“No one is interested in that now
“Just look
pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the
aspen tree-tops.

And these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers
that tone—hardly hostile
avoid.

Levin went up to Katavasov.

“It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come

“I’ve been meaning to a long while. Now we shall have some discussion
we’ll see to that. Have you been reading Spencer?”

“No
now.”

“How’s that? that’s interesting. Why so?”

“I mean that I’m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that
interest me I shall never find in him and his like. Now....”

But Katavasov’s serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck him
and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood
unmistakably disturbing by this conversation
resolution and stopped short.

“But we’ll talk later on
it’s this way

Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one
side with thick clumps of brilliant heart’s-ease among which stood up
here and there tall
guests in the dense
stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be
afraid of the bees
cucumbers

Trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible
to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him
along the little path to the hut. In the very entry one bee hummed
angrily
into the shady outer room
hung on a peg

the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows
on posts

In front of the openings of the hives
the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot
among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of
them
trees and back to the hives.

His ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes
busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off
lazy drone
property from the enemy and preparing to sting. On the farther side of
the fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub
not see Levin. Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did
not call him.

He was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of
ordinary actual life
thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan
show coolness to his brother

“Can it have been only a momentary mood
trace?” he thought. But the same instant
felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him.
Real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had
found

Just as the bees
his attention
forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them
cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap
restricted his spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he
was among them. Just as his bodily strength was still unaffected
spite of the bees
become aware of.

Chapter 15

“Do you know
here?” said Dolly
“with Vronsky! He’s going to Servia.”

“And not alone; he’s taking a squadron out with him at his own
expense

“That’s the right thing for him
going out then?” he added

Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer. He was carefully with a blunt knife
getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white
honeycomb.

“I should think so! You should have seen what was going on at the
station yesterday!” said Katavasov
cucumber.

“Well

conversation that had sprung up in Levin’s absence.

“With the Turks

Countess Lidia Ivanovna

“Well now

private persons the right to do so?”

“Oh
awful thing
individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;
that can only be done by a government
and is driven inevitably into war. On the other hand
science and common sense teach us that in matters of state
especially in the matter of war
personal individual will.”

Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready
speaking at the same time.

“But the point is
government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the
public asserts its will

But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer. His
brows contracted at Katavasov’s words and he said something else.

“You don’t put the matter in its true light. There is no question here
of a declaration of war
feeling. Our brothers
massacred. Even supposing they were not our brothers nor
fellow-Christians
aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.

“But I should not kill them

“Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is
Ivanovitch

yoke of the ‘unclean sons of Hagar.’ The people have heard of the

“Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case
Ivanovitch; “it’s not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia—the
whole people—has expressed its will.”

“But excuse me

“Oh

“But what was it in church on Sunday? The priest had been told to read
that. He read it. They didn’t understand a word of it. Then they were

the old bee-keeper.

The handsome old man
stood motionless
of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk
understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to
understand it.

“That’s so
Sergey Ivanovitch’s words.

“Here
said Levin. “Have you heard about the war
to him. “What they read in the church? What do you think about it?
Ought we to fight for the Christians?”

“What should we think? Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought
for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things. It’s clearer for him to
see. Shall I bring a bit more bread? Give the little lad some more?” he
said addressing Darya Alexandrovna and pointing to Grisha
finished his crust.

“I don’t need to ask
seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve
a just cause
express their thought and aim. They bring their halfpence or go
themselves and say directly what for. What does it mean?”

“It means
“that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not
hundreds

bands

“I tell you that it’s not a case of hundreds or of ne’er-do-wells
the best representatives of the people!” said Sergey Ivanovitch
as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his
fortune. “And what of the subscriptions? In this case it is a whole
people directly expressing their will.”

“That word ‘people’ is so vague
and one in a thousand of the peasants
The rest of the eighty millions

their will about. What right have we to say that this is the people’s
will?”

Chapter 16

Sergey Ivanovitch
once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.

“Oh
computation
has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced
not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of
reaching that. It is felt in the air

educated public

“Yes
“That’s true. But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak
before a storm. One can hear nothing for them.”

“Frogs or no frogs
defend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual
world
have answered

“Well
the prince. “There’s my son-in-law
He’s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or
other
it’s no secret!—and a salary of eight thousand. You try asking him
whether his post is of use
necessary. And he’s a truthful man too
believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles.”

“Yes
post
to be ill-timed.

“So it is with the unanimity of the press. That’s been explained to me:
as soon as there’s war their incomes are doubled. How can they help
believing in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and
all that?”

“I don’t care for many of the papers
Ivanovitch.

“I would only make one condition
Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: ‘You consider
war to be inevitable? Very good. Let everyone who advocates war be
enrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards

“A nice lot the editors would make!” said Katavasov
as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.

“But they’d run

“Oh
behind them

“But that’s a joke
prince

“I don’t see that it was a joke
Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.

“Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work
said he. “And men of thought are doing their work when they express
public opinion. And the single-hearted and full expression of public
opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at
the same time. Twenty years ago we should have been silent
have heard the voice of the Russian people
one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that
is a great step and a proof of strength.”

“But it’s not only making a sacrifice
timidly. “The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices

“For their soul? That’s a most puzzling expression for a natural

most.

“That’s so
them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction.

“Ah
Katavasov good-humoredly.

Levin reddened with vexation
failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.

“No
armor

He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov
and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them. What
they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his
ruin. He could not admit that some dozens of men
brother
hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital
and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people
and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder. He could not
admit this
the people among whom he was living
could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian
people)
could not know what is for the general good
doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict
observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to
every man
any general objects whatever. He said as Mihalitch did and the people
who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the
Varyagi: “Be princes and rule over us. Gladly we promise complete
submission. All the labor
upon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.” And now
to Sergey Ivanovitch’s account
they had bought at such a costly price.

He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide
then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement
in favor of the Slavonic peoples? But these were merely thoughts that
could settle nothing. One thing could be seen beyond doubt—that was
that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey
Ivanovitch
speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that
the storm clouds were gathering
before it rained.


Chapter 17

The old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off;
the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.

But the storm-clouds
quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the
rain. The foremost clouds
rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky. They were still two
hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up
every second the downpour might be looked for.

The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks. Darya
Alexandrovna

men of the party
her. They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the
edge of the iron guttering. The children and their elders after them
ran into the shelter of the house

“Katerina Alexandrovna?” Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna
with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.

“We thought she was with you

“And Mitya?”

“In the copse

Levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.

In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on
the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse. Stubbornly
though insisting on its rights
leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch
branches into strange unseemly nakedness
side—acacias
peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the
servants’ quarters. The streaming rain had already flung its white veil
over all the distant forest and half the fields close by
rapidly swooping down upon the copse. The wet of the rain spurting up
in tiny drops could be smelt in the air.

Holding his head bent down before him
that strove to tear the wraps away from him
copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree
when there was a sudden flash
vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead. Opening his blinded eyes
Levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from
the copse
of the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing
its position. “Can it have been struck?” Levin hardly had time to think
when
other trees
others.

The flash of lightning
chill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense of
terror.

“My God! my God! not on them!” he said.

And though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they
should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now
repeated it
senseless prayer.

Running up to the place where they usually went
there.

They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they
were calling him. Two figures in dark dresses (they had been light
summer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over
something. It was Kitty with the nurse. The rain was already ceasing
and it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them. The nurse
was not wet on the lower part of her dress
through
they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing
when the storm broke. Both stood bending over a perambulator with a
green umbrella.

“Alive? Unhurt? Thank God!” he said
through the standing water and running up to them.

Kitty’s rosy wet face was turned towards him
under her shapeless sopped hat.

“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? I can’t think how you can be so
reckless!” he said angrily to his wife.

“It wasn’t my fault
such a to-do that we had to change him. We were just....” Kitty began
defending herself.

Mitya was unharmed

“Well

They gathered up the baby’s wet belongings; the nurse picked up the
baby and carried it. Levin walked beside his wife
having been angry


Chapter 18

During the whole of that day
in which he took part
in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in
himself
of his heart.

After the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides
clouds still hung about the horizon
and thundery
the day in the house.

No more discussions sprang up; on the contrary
was in the most amiable frame of mind.

At first Katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes
always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him. Then Sergey
Ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting
observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common
houseflies
spirits
future of the Eastern question
that everyone listened eagerly.

Kitty was the only one who did not hear it all—she was summoned to give
Mitya his bath.

A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come
to the nursery.

Leaving his tea
conversation
sent for
the nursery.

Although he had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch’s views of
the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of
forty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia
quite new to him
being sent for by Kitty
was alone
And all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the
history of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was
passing in his own soul
back into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning.

He did not
thought—that he did not need. He fell back at once into the feeling
which had guided him
found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than
before. He did not

the feeling. Now
keener than ever

He walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out
in the darkening sky
sky
thought something
it was
will come clear!”

Just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had
shirked facing. It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His
revelation of what is right
the Christian church alone? What relation to this revelation have the
beliefs of the Buddhists

It seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not
time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.

Kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the
bath. Hearing her husband’s footstep
him to her with her smile. With one hand she was supporting the fat
baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back
she squeezed the sponge over him.

“Come
Mihalovna’s right. He knows us!”

Mitya had on that day given unmistakable
recognizing all his friends.

As soon as Levin approached the bath
was completely successful. The cook
over the baby. He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly. Kitty bent
down to him
the sponge and chirruped
with his lips
admiration. Levin

The baby was taken out of the bath
towels

“Well
husband
with the baby at her breast. “I am so glad! It had begun to distress
me. You said you had no feeling for him.”

“No; did I say that? I only said I was disappointed.”

“What! disappointed in him?”

“Not disappointed in him
had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise.
And then instead of that—disgust

She listened attentively
back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving
Mitya his bath.

“And most of all
pleasure. Today
love him.”

Kitty’s smile was radiant.

“Were you very much frightened?” she said. “So was I too
more now that it’s over. I’m going to look at the oak. How nice
Katavasov is! And what a happy day we’ve had altogether. And you’re so
nice with Sergey Ivanovitch
them. It’s always so hot and steamy here after the bath.”


Chapter 19

Going out of the nursery and being again alone
to the thought

Instead of going into the drawing-room
stopped on the terrace
up at the sky.

It was quite dark now
were no clouds. The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the
sky
quarter. Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in
the garden
the Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst. At each
flash of lightning the Milky Way
but as soon as the lightning died away
as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.

“Well
beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul
though he did not know it yet. “Yes
incontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and
wrong

whether I will or not—I am made one with other men in one body of
believers

himself the question he had feared to face. “Can these hundreds of
millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life
has no meaning?” He pondered a moment
himself. “But what am I questioning?” he said to himself. “I am
questioning the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of
all mankind. I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to all
the world with all those misty blurs. What am I about? To me
individually
doubt
express that knowledge in reason and words.

“Don’t I know that the stars don’t move?” he asked himself
the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig
of the birch-tree. “But looking at the movements of the stars
picture to myself the rotation of the earth
that the stars move.

“And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything
they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of
the earth? All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the
distances
are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a
stationary earth

observations of the seen heavens

which can always be trusted in my soul. The question of other religions
and their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide

“Oh
she came by the same way to the drawing-room.

“What is it? you’re not worried about anything?” she said
intently at his face in the starlight.

But she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not
hidden the stars and revealed it. In that flash she saw his face
distinctly

“She understands
Shall I tell her or not? Yes
about to speak

“Kostya! do something for me
see if they’ve made it all right for Sergey Ivanovitch. I can’t very
well. See if they’ve put the new wash stand in it.”

“Very well

“No
before him. “It is a secret for me alone
and not to be put into words.

“This new feeling has not changed me
enlightened all of a sudden
for my child. There was no surprise in this either. Faith—or not
faith—I don’t know what it is—but this feeling has come just as
imperceptibly through suffering

“I shall go on in the same way

tactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of
holies of my soul and other people
